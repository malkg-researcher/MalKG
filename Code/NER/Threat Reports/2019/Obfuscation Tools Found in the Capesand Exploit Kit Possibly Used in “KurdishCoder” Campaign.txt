Chen In November 2019, we published a blog analyzing an exploit kit we named Capesand that exploited AdobeFlash and Microsoft Internet Explorer .aws. During our analysis of the indicators of compromise (IoCs) inthe deployed samples that were infecting the victim¡¯s machines, we noticed some interesting characteristics:notably that these samples were making use of obfuscation tools that made them virtually undetectable. After some data collection we found more than 300 samples that correlate to the mentioned indicators thatwere recently very active our .rst detections occurred in August, with the campaign itself still ongoing(having occasional spikes in between). We saw a rising usage of tools that provide fully-undetectable obfuscation capabilities . signifying that the authors behind the samples designed their malware variants tobe as stealthy as possible. We decided to name the potential campaign associated with these IoCs as¡°KurdishCoder¡±, based on the property name of an assembly module found in one of the samples. We took a look at one of the samples captured from Capesand that was used to deploy the njRat malware .notably its main executable NotepadEx. We found that were multiple layers of obfuscation using acombination of two tools: the .NET protectors ConfuserEx and Cassandra (CyaX). Both of these tools areused in combination to provide an array of fully undetectable capabilities to the deployed njRat malwarevariant. Examining the Capesand samples The simpli.ed diagram taken from the previous blog shows the combination of ConfuserEx and Cassandravia the second layer of obfuscation protection, which involves the DLL CyaX_Sharp Assembly (bothCyaX_Sharp and CyaX are part of the Cassandra protector). Figure 1. The infection chain for Capesand that also shows the obfuscation mechanisms For this particular sample, CyaX_Sharp is obfuscated with a customized version of ConfuserEx. Thefollowing image shows an assembly module property that was generated for this sample. The module¡¯s property name is ¡°KurdishCoderProducts¡±, with a value shown to be ¡°ConfuserEx v1.0.0.custom¡±. To understand where this value is coming from, let¡¯s take a look at the open-source ConfuserExtool to see how the values are created. From there, we can establish a hypothesis as to their source. A closer look at ConfuserEx¡¯s functions While ConfuserEx is able to apply multiple transformations to the target binary, we are interested in twoparticular functions that we can use for correlation: 1. Source code building. ConfuserEx is an open-source tool with multiple versions hosted on Github. By examining one of the community-supported versions, we can see there is a tool to build ConfuserEx from the command line. This build command line has a function to update the .nal binary versions based on the last Git-tagged version.However, if ConfuserEx is built outside Git, the version update tool will just generate the value ¡°version.custom¡± as shown below. Figure 3. Code taken from a ConfuserEx version created outside GIT Since the string ¡°ConfuserEx v1.0.0-custom¡± is present in the module property: [module:KurdishCoderProducts(¡°ConfuserEx v1.0.0-custom¡±)]¡±, we can surmise that the version of ConfuserEx thatwas used for CyaX_Sharp was indeed built outside of Git. 1. Watermarking When ConfuserEx performs its obfuscation routine, one of the operations creates a watermark . a uniqueidenti.er within the software.that is present in the .nal binary. The watermarking technique is implementedthrough the module attributes of the assembly. The following source code screenshot shows how this isimplemented. Figure 4. Code showing how the watermarking is performed via the module attributes of the assembly From the previous code section, we can see the default attribute added by ConfuserEx is ¡°ConfusedBy¡±. Ifwe test it using a sample binary, the following is generated: Figure 5. Testing a sample binary using ConfuserEx There are two important aspects to this attribute: .rst, it is hardcoded as a string constant and second, itsvalue is presented in clear text in the .nal binary as the following image shows. Figure 6. The default attribute shown in clear text in the .nal binary We now have solid evidence that CyaX_Sharp was obfuscated using a modi.ed version of ConfuserEx, Next, let¡¯s look for the attribute indicator, starting with the CyaX assembly used in the NotepadEx attack. Cassandra Protector: CyaX After inspection we noticed that this version of CyaX was similarly notable due to two characteristics. First, the debug symbols paths were leaked ¡ª suggesting a possible custom build which can be correlatedwith another modi.cation applied to CyaX. Figure 7. The leaked debug symbols paths The second indicator has to do with one of the methods of CyaX which was modi.ed ¡ª speci.cally the oneinjecting the binary in memory. The following image shows the modi.ed function name. Figure 8. The modi.ed method which was renamed to Kirkuk, which is also a name of a city in Iraq What other payloads are using KurdishCoder? Analysis of some of the captured samples reveals the different payloads being used (as shown in the tablebelow). Note that this does not cover all the samples . it is possible that other payloads are being deployed aswell. KurdishCoderMai KurdishCoder_Cya CyaX_method_re Sample Payload nSample X_Sharp name CustomIncreaseX phoenix_keylogger Yes Yes Kirkuk NotePadEx Njrat No Yes Kirkuk QuickTranslation Agent Tesla Yes Yes Kurd SandiwchGenerato Agent Tesla Yes Yes Kirkukr SimpleGame Remcos Yes Yes Kirkuk Hawkeye RebordAnimalGames Yes Yes KurdKeylogger Table 1. The different samples organized name, payload delivered and the fully-undetectable stages where theattribute ¡°KurdishCoderProduction¡± is present Cassandra Crypter We think one of the possible sources of the customized ConfuserEx is the online service Cassandra Crypter,which offers two kinds of subscription plans: The Premium Plan and the Private Stub. The Premium Plan requires payment and works automatically, while the Private Stub requires the user to contact the supportfrom the service for further personalization. Figure 9. Cassandra Crypter¡¯s subscription plans The combination of ConfuserEx and CyaX (Cassandra protector) seems to be unique and customized basedon the indicators mentioned earlier.  While we don¡¯t have de.nitive evidence that the use of these tools are part of a single campaign, we think the analyzed samples are related to a speci.c campaign. Note that the KurdishCoder indicator was spotted also by the Italian Computer Emergency Response Team . PubblicaAmministrazione (CERT-PA), which they reported as a single incident. As with Capesand, we will be monitoring the use of the tools mentioned in this blog entry for any futuredevelopments and updates. Trend Micro Solutions A proactive, multilayered approach to security is key against a wide range of threats¡ª from the gateway,endpoints, networks, and servers. Trend Microþ Of.ceScanþ with XGenþ endpoint securityhas Vulnerability Protection that shields endpoints from identi.ed and unknown vulnerability exploits evenbefore patches are even deployed.
