This request http[:]//maq.com.pk/ for be redirected on the next URL. This seconds URL (http[:]//maq.com.pk/wehsd) send an RTF exploit. https://github.com/StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel/blob/master/offshore APT organization/Bitter/27-08-19/Malware analysis 31-08-19.md This exploit firstly executes a request by WebDAV and after by WebClient service for download the backdoor on the final address (http[:]//maq.com.pk/wehs) and execute it. Here we can see the redirection and the data sended on the victim. ArtraDownloader 9/2/2019 CyberThreatIntel/Malware analysis 31-08-19.md at master ， StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel In the first, we can see that launch by the factory option for separate the application of the current Explorer instance for avoid if one crashes the other stays alive (C:\Windows\explorer.exe /factory,{75dff2b7-6936-4c06-a8bb-676a7b00b24b} -Embedding). Secondly, we can note encoded string pushed on a function and the result is moved on another registry as storage for be used by the backdoor. In observing this function we can resume by the following algorithm used for decode these strings : for each byte of the string -> value of the byte -1 -> get Unicode value -> conver t to char. We can edit a script for decode the encoded string. Now we can see the actions did by the malware. https://github.com/StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel/blob/master/offshore APT organization/Bitter/27-08-19/Malware analysis 31-08-19.md Once this done, we can see on the entry point, this uses the startupinfo structure to specify window properties, verify the header of the PE and the get the environment values for create the process. The malware is coded in C++ language. We can observe that the malware pushes the persistence by a Run key in the registry. We can note too that use DOS commands with an environment value ("C:\ProgramData\Ntuser\winlgn.exe") for launch the backdoor. 9/2/2019 CyberThreatIntel/Malware analysis 31-08-19.md at master ， StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel This query the registry for getting, the version of the OS and proceeds for identifying the victim.s machine GUID by the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid registry key. This use too, the EncodePointer function for encoding a specified pointer (encoded pointers can be used to provide another layer of protection for pointer values). https://github.com/StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel/blob/master/offshore APT organization/Bitter/27-08-19/Malware analysis 31-08-19.md After performing the reconnaissance actions, this can send a query as pulse with the informations to the C2, the URL to send is decoded and an additional operation give the final URL. The data are encoded by the algorithm too, with the script, we can decode the strings and see that the roles and data send to the C2. 9/2/2019 CyberThreatIntel/Malware analysis 31-08-19.md at master ， StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel SNI=VTFS.QD&UME=Xjoepxt!8!Qspgfttjpobm&OPQ=benjo&IVR=VTFS.QD$$benjoAA11482.572.3314613.96675&st=0 (Here from the Anyrun sandbox) We can resume all the variables used and the type of the informations sent in the C2. Variable  Description  SNI  Computer name  UME  OS Version  OP  Account name  IVR  [Computer name]##[Account name]@@[GUID]  st  downloaded file executed successfully ?  Cyber kill chain This process graph represents the cyber kill chain of Bitter sample. Cyber Threat Intel Since the last 2 weeks, the C2 domain have changed (.193 to .198) due to this are on the same subnet of the Verdina organization (Bulgaria cloud provider). We can note on the WHOIS information that this registered in Ras al-khaimah location. https://github.com/StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel/blob/master/offshore APT organization/Bitter/27-08-19/Malware analysis 31-08-19.md The location is placed in the business place of the city. 9/2/2019 CyberThreatIntel/Malware analysis 31-08-19.md at master ， StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel We can note that two phone numbers with the country indicate (Indian and Iranian) have the same address for two companies. In Ras al-Khaimah, there is no corporate tax, no profits, no customs duties, no inheritance tax, it is not excluding that the group Bitter chose this place as a tax haven for their operations. References MITRE ATT&CK Matrix List of all the references with MITRE ATT&CK Matrix Enterprise tactics Technics used Ref URL Execution T1203 -Exploitation for Client Execution https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203 Persistence T1060 -Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1060 Discovery T1012 -uery Registry https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012 Lateral Movement T1105 -Remote File Copy https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105 C & C T1105 -Remote File Copy https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105 List of all the Indicators Of Compromise (IOC) https://github.com/StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel/blob/master/offshore APT organization/Bitter/27-08-19/Malware analysis 31-08-19.md Indicators Of Compromise (IOC) 9/2/2019 CyberThreatIntel/Malware analysis 31-08-19.md at master ， StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel Indicator  Description  Urgent Action.docx  34b53cd683f60800ac4057d25b24d8f083f759d024d22b4e5f2a464bc85de65  smss.exe  dcb8531b0879d46949dd63b1ac094f5588c26867805d0795e244f4f9b8077ed  maq.com.pk  Domain requested  203.124.43.227  IP requested  http[:]//maq.com.pk/  HTTP/HTTPS requests  http[:]//maq.com.pk/wehsd  HTTP/HTTPS requests  http[:]//maq.com.pk/wehs  HTTP/HTTPS requests  http[:]//onlinejohnline99.org/kvs06v.php  HTTP/HTTPS requests  onlinejohnline99.org  Domain C2  93.123.73.193  IP C2  93.123.73.198  IP C2  This can be exported as JSON format Export in JSON Links Original tweet: https://twitter.com/RedDrip7/status/1164855381052416002 Anyrun Link: Urgent Action.docx Docs : Bitter Analysis by Unit42 Tool for decoding the encoded strings of ArtraDownloader YARA Rule Bitter Variant1 (August 2019) https://github.com/StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel/blob/master/offshore APT organization/Bitter/27-08-19/Malware analysis 31-08-19.md
