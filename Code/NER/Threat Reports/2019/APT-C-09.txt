After taking a deeper analysis, we .gure out that the C2 con.gurations are located on Github and Feed43. Multiple Github spaces have been exposed through correlation analysis and the earliest one could trace back to July 2018. The relevant accounts were still in use when the report was completed. Decryption algorithm for con.gurations retrieved from Github will be described in detail and the portrait of the attacker is partially based on statistics of the decrypted data. Sample Analysis The related attack vector is an XLSM .le, created on August 8 and uploaded to VT on August 13, that leverages CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability to release MSBuild.exe to the %AppData% directory and then add registry Run key to stay persistent. To obtain C2 address, it reads data from Github and Feed43 where the content could be controlled by attackers. HTTP/HTTPS protocols are used while communicating with available C2s. Dropper Analysis The sample was uploaded to VT at 5:05 on Aug 13, 2019 with below details: MD5 0D38ADC0B048BAB3BD91861D42CD39DF Name India makes Kashmir Dangerous Place in the World.xlsm Time 2019-08-13 05:05:15 After opening, a blurred picture shows up to lure the victim to enable macro. After that, a clear picture titled "India has made Kashmir the most dangerous place in the world" gets displayed. MSBuild.exe Analysis MSBuild.exe is released to the %AppData% directory, and the compilation time is August 8th, 2019 which coincides with the XML creation time on Github that will be described later on: Name MSBuild.exe MD5 0f4f6913c3aa57b1fc5c807e0bc060fc Compile Time 2019-08-08 14:00:32 The main purpose of this sample is to obtain C2 con.guration from the attacker's Github and feed43 space, and then performs decryption and connects to C2 for further communications. After the malicious code is executed, it will “sleep” for a period of time. This is implemented by executing function in a loop for 80,000 times, to delay execution in the sandbox: feed43 URL https://node2.feed43.com/0056234178515131.xml Github URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petersonmike/test/master/xml.xml The Github account used by the attacker is created on August 7th, 2019, which matches the compilation time of the sample: F0 E1 D2 C3 B4 A5 96 87 78 69 5A 4B 3C 2D 1E 0F 00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 The decrypted C2 address is 139.28.38.236 and the malware uses HTTP/HTTPS in network communication: URI Content https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/apt-c-09-reappeared-as-con.ict-intensi.ed-between-india-and-pakistan/uuid ID generated by GetCurrentHwPro.le un System info cn  Computer name  on  OS version  lan  IP list  nop  Blank  ver  Malware version, here it is 1.0  After that the malware enters a while loop, to perform actions according to HTTP response: URI Function /e3e7e71a0b28b5e96cc492e636722f73/4sVKAOvu3D/ABDYot0NxyG.php Online, message queue /e3e7e71a0b28b5e96cc492e636722f73/4sVKAOvu3D/UYEfgEpXAOE.php Upload data Token Function 0 Exit 8 Upload keylog .le 23 Upload screen capture .le 13 Upload collected list of .les for a speci.c suf.x 5 Upload local .le 33 Extract EXE download link from URL, then download and execute. The attacker uploads the .les generated after executing remote commands to the C&C server. The following table is a comparison table of the cached .les and the contents of the records: File Name Content 9PT568.dat UUID TPX498.dat Keylog .le TPX499.dat Screen capture .le AdbFle.tmp Retrieved .les speci.ed by attacker edg499.dat Files with speci.c suf.xes:(".txt",".doc",".xls",".xlsx",".docx",".xls",".ppt",".pptx",".pdf") The malware collects a list of .les with speci.c suf.xes, stores them in a local .le, and uploads to the C2 server: Data Analysis After performing correlation analysis, we discovered 44 con.guration .les hosted on Github and utilized by this APT group. All C2s have been decrypted and extracted for investigation. From the time of .le creation, the attacker started working at least as early as July 2018. The earliest created account was on July 3, 2018, and continued to August 2019 when the document was completed. In terms of the statistics of monthly creations, the number of creations in July 2018 is much higher than the follow-up. We give the following reasonable speculations based on the data distribution. The attacker may conduct a concentrated attack from July to September in 2018. Accounts are created on demand when the sample gets updated or related Github link is blocked. malikzafar786,Zunaid.zunaid1,a1amir1,Alaeck,aleks0rg0v,alexboycott,alfreednobeli,chrisyoks,dawoood,ehsaankhan,fakheragainfkhr,fang.ee,habrew,hazkabeeb,husngilgit,imranikhan17,imrankh Keywords such as “android” and “mobile” are used in the Github directory, perhaps it indicates there are samples for Android phones. https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/apt-c-09-reappeared-as-con.ict-intensi.ed-between-india-and-pakistan/i i i on,Joncorbat,kjh k hjk ,l k ngd,mdfs,metest,mobil6/9 eapp,mobilegame,mtesty,test,amn gomestro,andro d,blch,cartoon,fash on,harrypotter,haz,helbrat,huric,husnahazrt,introducti l j l i i Most of the C2s are located in Ukraine while there are 2 IPs in China: Conclusion The link to feeds.rapidfeeds.com left in its XML con.guration .le was also mentioned by Kaspersky’s report in the reference section, which con.rms that the APT-C-09 group keeps updating its C2 con.guration channel and the recent one reserves some past features. In the perspective of cyber wars, the con.ict between India and Pakistan over the territory of Kashmir has lasted for decades, which makes it a perfect topic in target attacks. For example, Donot and Bitter disguised as Kashmiri Voice to attack Pakistan, Transparent Tribe attacked India with decoy document regarding terrorist attacks in Kashmir. These combats have proved that national power plays an important role in defending the national sovereignty and in the mean while spying on the military intelligence. India’s attempt to abolish India-controlled Kashmir is to detonate the con.ict between the two countries. The two sides exchanged .re and some soldiers have died because of this. In terms of cyber attacks, related incidences will continue to rise up. Considering APT-C-09, Bitter and Donot have carried out targeted attacks against China, we must take actions in advance and keep a close eye on their recent activities. QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center will provide customers with the latest attack trends in the .rst time, helping government and enterprises to resist network intrusions from foreign enemies. IOCs C2: https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/apt-c-09-reappeared-as-con.ict-intensi.ed-between-india-and-pakistan/AES Key: 7/9 DD1876848203D9E10ABCEEC07282FF37 BlowFish Key: F0E1D2C3B4A5968778695A4B3C2D1E0F0011223344556677 Host Name: WIN-ABPA7FG820B Appendix: Extracted C2 Information C2 Time Github username http://149.56.80.64/u5b62ed973d963913bb/u5a3ewfasdk9.php 2018-07-03T05:19:43 y4seenkhan http://149.56.80.64/u5b62ed973d963913bb/u5a3ewfasdk9.php 2018-07-03T05:29:54 hazkabeeb http://43.249.37.165/kungfu/ghsnls.php 2018-07-04T12:45:13 Zunaid-zunaid1 http://123.57.158.115/shujing/ghsnls.php 2018-07-04T14:39:00 Zunaid-zunaid1 185.82.217.200/@lb3rt/dqvabs.php 2018-07-04T20:46:50 Zunaid-zunaid1 185.82.217.200/N3wt0n/dqvabs.php 2018-07-04T22:01:40 aleks0rg0v http://185.82.217.200/d3m0n/dqvabs.php 2018-07-05T10:43:25 Vldir http://81.17.30.28/th0mas/dqvabs.php 2018-07-05T20:30:57 Alaeck http://46.183.216.222/0racl3/dqvabs.php 2018-07-07T12:10:04 yamichaeldavid http://91.229.79.183/b15d0e30a7738037/j8.andfuesmg.php 2018-07-10T16:26:55 habrew http://176.107.182.24/f0357a3f154bc2ff/sadk9f043ejf.php 2018-07-10T16:35:49 ehsaankhan http://146.185.234.71/Ms3f3g45thgy5/f3af3fasf32.php 2018-07-11T00:03:07 dawoood http://185.203.116.58/d394d142687ff5a0/dfae43rsfdgq4e.php 2018-07-11T01:24:49 fang.ee 185.156.173.73 2018-07-11T02:47:04 noorhasima http://188.165.124.30/c6afebaa8acd80e7/byuehf8af.php 2018-07-11T03:15:07 alfreednobeli http://146.185.234.71/Ms3f3g45thgy5/f3af3fasf32.php 2018-07-11T09:27:55 jahilzubaine 94.156.35.204 2018-07-11T11:23:16 husngilgit http://94.156.35.204/22af645d1859cb5c/sg4gasdnjf984.php 2018-07-11T16:26:29 raqsebalooch 185.203.118.115 2018-07-12T10:19:05 lctst 185.29.11.59 2018-07-13T18:28:04 rehmanlaskkr ?桔%?.`辚3 2018-07-13T19:33:56 noor.rdousi 185.206.144.67 2018-07-14T12:04:38 rizvirehman 185.36.188.14 2018-08-20T10:58:18 fakheragainfkhr 199.168.138.119 2018-08-24T12:46:00 malikzafar786 199.168.138.119 2018-08-24T12:55:02 malikzafar786 199.168.138.119 2018-08-24T12:57:59 malikzafar786 85.217.171.138 2018-09-01T09:47:20 malikzafar786 85.217.171.138 2018-09-01T09:53:03 malikzafar786 http://46.183.216.222/0racl3/dqvabs.php 2018-09-01T10:35:34 malikzafar786 199.168.138.119 2018-09-18T10:34:23 malikzafar786 199.168.138.119 2018-09-18T10:37:49 malikzafar786 193.37.213.101 2018-11-05T11:53:40 a1amir1 178.33.94.35 2018-12-05T12:11:46 malikzafar786 178.33.94.35 2018-12-05T12:38:34 malikzafar786 ;3.??^a;?筛 2018-12-17T06:50:14 yusufk1 185.29.11.59 2019-01-15T08:03:17 str1ngstr 164.132.75.22 2019-03-01T05:28:04 z00min 193.22.98.17 2019-05-27T05:47:11 alexboycott 91.92.136.239 2019-06-24T11:14:16 imrankhan713 91.92.136.239 2019-06-24T12:05:21 imranikhan17https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/apt-c-09-reappeared-as-con.ict-intensi.ed-between-india-and-pakistan/ 8/28/2019 奇安信威胁情报中.  185.161.210.8 139.28.38.231 139.28.38.236  2019-07-18T12:10:48 2019-08-07T10:58:56 2019-08-08T09:06:03  johnhenery12 petersonmike shaikmalik22  Reference  1. https://securelist.com/the-dropping-elephant-actor/75328/
