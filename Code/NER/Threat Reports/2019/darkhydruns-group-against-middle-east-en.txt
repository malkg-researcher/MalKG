A backdoor dropped by macro in the lure documents can communicate with C2 server through DNS tunnel, as well as Google Drive API. We con.rmed that this is a DarkHydrus Group’s new attack targeting Middle East region. In July 2018, Palo Alto disclosed DarkHydrus Group which showed its special interest to governments in Middle East[1]. Prior to that report, we published detail analysis on malware exploiting CVE-2018-8414 vulnerability (remote code execution in SettingContent-ms), which is believed a work of DarkHydrus[2]. Timeline Timeline of activities of DarkHydrus Group: Kaspersky named “LazyMeerkat” to this APT group.

If ‘st:o.’ presents, no persistence entry is added; PDF .le is not dropped if ‘pd:o.’ exists. Then it detects existence of virtual machine and sandbox before malicious payload is triggered. . A registry entry is added for persistence：It can drop a PDF .le：Codes of virtual machine detection, sandbox detection and anti-debug are following, . Next, the backdoor will collect host name . The backdoor will send collected information to C2 server through DNS tunnel. queryTypesTest function is created for DNS tunnel communication. Then, the backdoor tries to retrieve commands from C2 server via DNS tunnel, then through HTTP if failed. After C2 commands is retrieved successfully, commands are dispatched by taskHandler. . Screenshot of a part of C2 commands “^\\$x_mode” command sets .le server address which is sent in DNS tunnel. . One .le server is Google Drive https://www.googleapis.com/upload/drive/v3/.les/" + .le_id + "? supportsTeamDrive=true&uploadType=resumable&.elds=kind,id,name,mimeType,parents All command lists are following： Command Feature ^kill Kill thread or process ^\$.leDownload Download .le ^\$importModule Import module ^\$x_mode In x_mode，con.gure C2 address，then send RAT data to C2 by HTTP protocol ^\$ClearModules Remove module ^\$.leUpload Upload .le ^testmode Test module ^showcon.g Show con.guration . 1/17/2019  360威胁情报中心  ^changeCon.g  Change con.guration  ^slp  Sleep  ^exit  Exit process  DNS Tunnel  DNS tunnel is a C2 communication technique in which malware send data and retrieve commands by DNS query packets. This technique is very e.ective since most gateways or .rewalls allow both ingress and egress DNS tra.c. If C2 server is assigned in the format of IP address in malware body, malware can contact C2 directly. But O.ceUpdateService.exe backdoor has C2 server in the format of DNS name, which requires a DNS resolution to C2 domain name .rst. To do that, the backdoor queries C2 domain in speci.c name server. Then the backdoor communicates C2 server in DNS tunnel. C2 domain names are following：Name Server Malware sends DNS queries to these two name servers for C2 domain name resolution: ‘tvs1.tra.cmanager.live’ and ‘tvs2.tra.cmanager.live’ Malware uses nslookup to send out DNS query, with following parameters: ‘timeout’ and ‘q’ for DNS record type . C&C Commands To parse C2 commands from above types of DNS records, the malware uses di.erent regular expressions. For example, if commands are sent back in DNS A record, the malware will use following regular expression: Malware will retrieve a process ID as victim ID, then treats victim ID as subdomain name in C2 communication. . C2 commands are parsed out by regular expressions based on DNS record types. We manually send out a DNS TXT query with victim ID as illustration. A domain name ‘ajpinc.akamaiedge.live’ is created. In subdomain ‘ajpinc’, ‘a’ means this is the .rst request, and ‘c’ is the character for string end, while ‘jpin’ is process ID. Then, we send DNS query by using nslookup command as following The malware will use following regular expression to parse out command, ([\\w+). (akdns.live|akamaiedge.live|edgekey.live|akamaized.live](.le://w+). (akdns.live|akamaiedge.live|edgekey.live|akamaized.live)). . Finally, system con.guration is sent to C2 server in DNS protocol. Communication Rule This malware uses following types of DNS record A AAAA . AC CNAME TXT SRV SOA MX To parse C2 commands from above types of DNS records, the malware uses di.erent regular expressions. For example, if commands are sent back in DNS AC record, the malware will use following regular expression: Following regular expression is for commands in DNS AAAA records, . And there is one regular expression for several DNS record types, including CNAME, SRV, SOA, . Breakdown of regular expressions are as following, Types of DNS record Regular expressions A Address:\\s+(\\d+.\\d+.\\d+.\\d+) AC ([^r-v\\s]+)[r-v]([\\w\\d+\\/=]+)-\\w+.(<C2DOMIAN>) AAAA Address:\\s+(([a-fA-F0-9]{0,4}:{1,4}[\\w|:]+){1,8}) ([^r-v\\s]+)[r-v]([\\w\\d+\\/=]+)-\\w+.(<C2DOMIAN>) CNAME、TXT、SRV、SOA、MX and (\\w+).(<C2DOMIAN>) However, the malware will cancel operation if commands is matched by following regular expression: "216.58.192.174|2a00:1450:4001:81a::200e|2200::|download.microsoft.com|ntservicepack.microsoft.com|window supdate.microsoft.com|update.microsoft.com" . Attribution We found some traces which lead us to believe that DarkHydrus is behind this attack. Samples with DNS Tunnel Function Similar to the malware disclosed by Palo Alto[2], both malware use DNS tunnel technique: Sandbox detection and Backdoor Capability The new malware has very similar code of detection to sandbox and virtual machine as previous DarkHydrus samples Both samples have very similar code and functionality: . Pivot One interesting .nding is that, there is one Twitter user Steve Williams with handle name @darkhydrus2. It’s coincident that both ‘darkhydrus’ (APT group name) and ‘Williams’ (user name in PDB path) found in this Twitter user. . Summary In recent APT incidents, more and more threat actors tend to adopt O.ce VBA macro instead of O.ce 0day vulnerability in the consideration of cost reduction. It is recommended that users avoid to open documents from untrusted sources. And O.ce macro should be disabled by default. Products of 360 ESG can protect users from this new malware, including 360 Threat Intelligence Platform, SkyEye APT Detection, 360 NGSOC. IOC . MD5 1/17/2019 360威胁情报中心 5c3f96ade0ea67eef9d25161c64e6f3e 8dc9f5450402ae799f5f8afd5c0a8352 b108412f1cdc0602d82d3e6b318dc634 039bd47f0fdb6bb7d68a2428c71f317d PDB PATH C:\Users\william\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\DNSProject\DNSProject\obj\Release\DNSProject.pdb C2 0.ce365.life 0.ce365.services 0nedrive.agency akamai.agency akamaiedge.live akamaiedge.services akamaized.live akdns.live azureedge.today cloudfronts.services corewindows.agency edgekey.live microsoftonline.agency nsatc.agency onedrive.agency phicdn.world sharepoint.agency skydrive.agency skydrive.services t-msedge.world tra.cmanager.live References [1]. https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/analysis-of-settingcontent-ms-.le/ . 1/17/2019 360威胁情报中心 [2]. https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-new-threat-actor-group-darkhydrus-targets-middle.east-government/ [3]. https://ti.360.net/ [4]. https://twitter.com/craiu/status/1083305994652917760 .APT DARKHYDRUNS分享到： . .首页 Latest Target Attack of DarkHydruns Group Against Middle East. .
