1: 
Possible 
interception 
points on 
the 
path 
between 
the 
potential 
victim＊s machine 
and 
the 
Adobe 
servers. 
Note 
that 
the 
scenario 
under 
#5 
is seen 
as 
very unlikely. 
The 
possible 
attack 
vectors ESET 
researchers considered 
are: 
A 
machine 
within 
the 
network 
of 
the 
victim＊s organization 
could 
be 
hijacked 
so 
that 
it 
acts as a 
springboard 
for 
a 
local 
Man-in-the-Middle 
(MitM) 
attack. 
This would 
e.ectively involve 
on-the-.y redirection 
of 
the 
tra.c 
of 
the 
targeted 
machine 
to 
a 
compromised 
machine 
on 
the 
local 
network. 
The 
attackers could 
also 
compromise 
the 
network 
gateway of 
an 
organization, 
enabling 
them 
to 
intercept 
all 
the 
incoming 
and 
outgoing 
tra.c 
between 
that 
organization＊s intranet 
and 
the 
internet. 
The 
tra.c 
interception 
could 
also 
occur 
at 
the 
level 
of 
internet 
service 
providers (ISPs), 
a 
tactic 
that 
每 as evidenced 
by recent 
ESET 
research 
into 
surveillance 
campaigns 
deploying 
FinFisher 
spyware 
每 is not 
unheard 
of. 
All 
the 
known 
victims are 
located 
in 
di.erent 
countries, 
and 
we 
identi.ed 
them 
using 
at 
least 
four 
di.erent 
ISPs. 
The 
attackers could 
have 
used 
a 
Border 
Gateway 
Protocol 
(BGP) 
hijack 
to 
re-route 
the 
tra.c 
to 
a 
server 
controlled 
by Turla, 
although 
this 
tactic 
would 
probably 
rather 
quickly set 
o. 
alarm 
bells with 
Adobe 
or 
BGP 
monitoring 
services. 
Once 
the 
fake 
Flash 
installer 
is downloaded 
and 
launched, 
one 
of 
several 
backdoors is dropped. 
It 
could 
be 
Mosquito, 
which 
is a 
piece 
of 
Win32 
malware, 
a 
malicious JavaScript 
.le 
communicating 
with 
a 
web 
app 
hosted 
on 
Google 
Apps Script, 
or 
an 
unknown 
.le 
downloaded 
from 
a 
bogus 
and 
non-existent 
Adobe 
URL. 
The 
stage 
is then 
set 
for 
the 
mission＊s main 
goal 
每 ex.ltration 
of 
sensitive 
data. 
This information 
includes the 
unique 
ID 
of 
the 
compromised 
machine, 
the 
username, 
and 
the 
list 
of 
security products installed 
on 
the 
device. 
＆Only＊ 
the 
username 
and 
device 
name 
are 
ex.ltrated 
by Turla＊s 
backdoor 
Snake 
on 
macOS. 
At 
the 
.nal 
part 
of 
the 
process, 
the 
fake 
installer 
drops 每 or 
downloads 每 and 
then 
runs a 
legitimate 
Flash 
Player 
application. 
The 
latter＊s installer 
is 
either 
embedded 
in 
its fake 
counterpart 
or 
is downloaded 
from 
a 
Google 
Drive 
web 
address. 
Mosquito 
and 
JavaScript 
backdoors 
ESET 
researchers have 
seen 
in 
the 
wild, 
new 
samples of 
the 
backdoor 
known 
as Mosquito. 
The 
more 
recent 
iterations are 
more 
heavily 
obfuscated 
with 
what 
appears to 
be 
a 
custom 
crypter, 
to 
make 
analysis 
more 
di.cult 
both 
for 
malware 
researchers and 
for 
security software＊s 
code. 
In 
order 
to 
establish 
persistence 
on 
the 
system, 
the 
installer 
tampers with 
the 
operating 
system＊s registry. 
It 
also 
creates an 
administrative 
account 
that 
allows remote 
access. 
The 
main 
backdoor 
CommanderDLL 
has the 
.pdb 
extension. 
It 
uses a 
custom 
encryption 
algorithm 
and 
can 
execute 
certain 
prede.ned 
actions. 
The 
backdoor 
keeps track 
of 
everything 
it 
does on 
the 
compromised 
machine 
in 
an 
encrypted 
log 
.le. 
Turla 
has been 
operating 
for 
a 
number 
of 
years and 
its activities have 
been 
monitored 
and 
analyzed 
by ESET 
research 
laboratories. 
Last 
year, 
the 
analysts released 
pieces covering 
new 
versions 
of 
another 
Turla 
backdoor 
called 
Carbon, 
watering 
hole 
campaigns 
misusing 
a 
Firefox 
browser 
extension 
and, 
most 
recently, 
a 
backdoor 
called 
Gazer.
