Few cybercrime groups have gained as much notoriety¡ªboth for their actions and for theirmystique¡ªas the Lazarus group. Since they .rst emerged back in 2007 with a series ofcyberespionage attacks against the South Korean government, these threat actors have successfullymanaged to pull off some of the most notable and devastating targeted attacks¡ªsuch as the widely-reported.2014 Sony hack.and the.2016 attack on a Bangladeshi bank¡ªin recent history. 
Throughout the Lazarus group¡¯s operational history, few threat actors have managed to match thegroup in terms of both scale and impact, due in large part to the wide variety of tools and tactics atthe group¡¯s disposal. 
The malware known as RATANKBA is just one of the weapons in Lazarus¡¯ arsenal. This malicioussoftware, which could have been active since.late 2016, was used in a.recent campaign targeting 
.nancial institutions.using.watering hole.attacks. The variant used during these attacks(TROJ_RATANKBA.A) delivered multiple payloads that include hacking tools and softwaretargeting banking systems. We analyzed a new RATANKBA variant (BKDR_RATANKBA.ZAEL¨C A), discovered in June 2017, that uses a PowerShell script instead of its more traditional PEexecutable form¡ªa version that other researchers also recently identi.ed. 

We identi.ed a number of servers Lazarus used as a backend system for temporarily holding stolendata. We were able to access this backend, which provided us with valuable information about thisattack and its victims. 
Around 55% of the victims of RATANKBA¡¯s Powershell version were located in India and neighboring countries. This implies that the Lazarus group could be is either collecting intelligenceabout targets in this region, or is at an early stage of planning. They could have also beenperforming exercises in preparation for an attack against similar targets. 
The majority of the observed victims were not using enterprise versions of Microsoftsoftware..Less than 5% of the victims were Microsoft Windows Enterprise users, which means thatcurrently, RATANKBA mostly affects smaller organizations or individual users, not largerorganizations. It¡¯s possible that Lazarus is using tools other than RATANKBA to target largerorganizations. 
Lazarus¡¯ backend logs also record victim IP addresses. Based on a reverse WHOIS lookup, none ofthe victims can be associated with a large bank or a .nancial institution. However, we did manageto identify victims that are likely employees of three web software development companies in Indiaand one in South Korea. 
Infection Flow 
Figure 1: RATANKBA Infection Flow 
RATANKBA is delivered to its victims using a variety of lure documents, including MicrosoftOf.ce documents, malicious CHM .les, and different script downloaders..These documentscontain topics discussing either software development or digital currencies. The growth ofcryptocurrencies may be a driving force behind the use of cryptocurrency-related lures. 
An example of a lure used in a RATANKBA attack can be seen below: 
Figure 2: Malicious CHM .le used as RATANKBA lure 
Once the lure¡¯s recipient opens and executes the .le, a backdoor will be dropped into the victim¡¯ssystem. This RATANKBA backdoor is what is used to communicate with RATANKBA¡¯sCommand-and-Control (C&C) server. We have observed two initial conversations with the C&Cserver (all are done via HTTP GET or POST to the server): 

HTTP
 POST to {script}.jsp?action=BaseInfo&u=XXX: Sends the victim information to the backend server 


HTTP
 GET to {script}.jsp?action=What&u=XXX: Checks if there are any pending jobs for thebackdoor This means that the backdoor is responsible for both uploading victim information, as well asexecuting any tasks that the controller has assigned to it, which includes the following: 



Killkill: Stops the backdoor¡¯s activities 

interval:.Changes the interval in which the backdoor retrieves jobs; the default interval is set at 120seconds 

cmd:.Executes shell commands 

exe:Re.ectively injects a DLL downloaded from a speci.c URLIn addition to the backdoor¡¯s modus operandi, the attackers will use a Microsoft WMI command-line tool to list the compromised system¡¯s running processes, which are sent to the C&C server: 

¡°C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe¡±
 /c ¡°wmic process get processid,commandline,sessionid | .ndstrSysWOW¡± 


¡°C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe¡±
 /c ¡°wmic process get processid,commandline,sessionid | .ndstrx86¡± 


Technical Analysis 
During our analysis, we collected a copy of the RATANKBA malware¡¯s Lazarus Remote Controllertool. The remote controller provides a user interface that allows attackers to send jobs to anycompromised endpoint..The controller gives the attackers the ability to manipulate the victims¡¯ hostby queueing tasks on the main server. RATANKBA retrieves and executes the tasks, and retrievesthe collected information. 
Figure 3: RATANKBA communication diagram 
The RATANKBA malware has a control model that does not use real-time communication between the backdoor and the attacker. Instead, both the remote controller and the backdoor connect to its main communication control server to push or pull pieces of information. The controller uses agraphical UI interface and can be used to push code to the server, while the backdoor regularlyconnects to the server to check for pending tasks..The controller downloads the victim pro.les fromthe server. If the pro.les are already downloaded by the controller, they are deleted from the serverside. The controller can post victim-speci.c tasks as well as global speci.c tasks to the server.Below are the various functionalities of RATANKBA¡¯s controller: 
Command Name Function 
get_time Retrieves the server time delete_inf Deletes the downloaded victim pro.lesdelete_con Deletes the connection log .les if they were
already downloadedKill: Posts a job to kill the backdoorinject Posts a job for DLL injectionInterval Changes the sleep intervalCmd Posts a job for command shell executiondelete_cmd Retrieves the job results and deletes the posted
jobbroadcast_cmd: Posts a job for all the backdoors connecting tothe server

RATANKBA¡¯s controllers use the ¡°Nimo Software HTTP Retriever 1.0¡±.user-agent string for itscommunication. The communication protocol format for the controller and backdoor is as follows: 
<domain>/<jsp .lename>.jsp?action=<corresponding actions plus additional neededparameters>`
One of most notable changes on the new RATANKBA variant is that the new version was writtenin Powershell, whereas the original variant was in PE form. The shift from PE to Powershell makesit more dif.cult for antivirus solutions to detect. The screenshot below shows the conversion from C/C++ code to Powershell, while the protocol remained unchanged.

Pro.le of the Attackers 
While we do not have any knowledge of who the actual Lazarus attackers are, the data collectedfrom the backend systems gives us some insights into the internet usage patterns of systems likelyowned by Lazarus group members. Clues regarding the pro.les of the attackers was also found,including those connected to developers and at least one operator. All of them appear to be nativeKorean speakers, or at least have Korean language pro.ciency that is at the near-native level.. We believe at least one of them also understands Chinese. 
We also observed clues that the attackers are interested in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC)and Ant Share (NEO). One of them transferred shares of NEO at a good market price.

Defending against RATANKBA 
Given Lazarus¡¯ use of a wide array of tools and techniques in their operations, it¡¯s reasonable toassume that the group will continue to use ever-evolving tactics in their malicious activities.Overall, an organization will need multilayered security strategies, as Lazarus and other similargroups are experienced cybercriminals who employ different strategies to get past organizationaldefenses. 
The impact of this malware can be mitigated with proven mitigation techniques such as routinelyscanning the network for any malicious activity to help prevent the malware from entering andspreading through an organization. In addition, educating employees and other key people in anorganization on.social engineering techniques.can allow them to identify what to look out for whenit comes to malicious attacks. 
Other mitigation strategies include a multilayered approach to securing the organization¡¯sperimeter, which includes.hardening the endpoints.and employing.application control.to helpprevent malicious applications and processes from being executed.
