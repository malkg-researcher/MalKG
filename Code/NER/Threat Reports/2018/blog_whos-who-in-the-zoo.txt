WebpageconvertedtoPDFwiththePDFmyURLPDFcreationAPI!Evolution of ZooPark malware features 
WebpageconvertedtoPDFwiththePDFmyURLPDFcreationAPI!We have observed two main distribution vectors for ZooPark ¨C Telegram channels and watering holes. The second one was the preferred vector: we found several news websites that have been hacked by the attackers to redirect visitors to a downloading site that serves malicious APKs. Some of the themes observed in campaign include ¡°Kurdistan referendum¡±, ¡°TelegramGroups¡± and ¡°Alnaharegypt news¡±, among others. 

Target profile has evolved during the last years of campaign, focusing on victims in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Lebanon and Iran.
