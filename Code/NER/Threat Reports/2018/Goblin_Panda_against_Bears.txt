Goblin Panda against the Bears 
During my last investigation (here), I¡¯ve found two RTFs malware documents with the same techniques of exploitation of CVE-2017¨C 11882: 
A le 8.t in %TMP% with Package Ole Object 
The same loop of decryption 
The same runPE after overwriting in memory EQNEDT32.exe 
But the payload is really dierent. It¡¯s not a version of PlugX but a version of Sisder studied by Ncc group. https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-
events/blogs/2018/june/cve-2017-8570-rtf-and-the-sisfader-rat/ 

With the behaviour graph of Joe Sandbox, we can recognize the same interactions with operating system than my last article and the paper of NCC Group. 

Behaviour of malwares 
The dierence with the version studied by NCC Group is the Package Ole Object. In the article of NCC Group, the researchers talk about a SCT File and many javascript manipulations for dropping the RAT on the disk and to start it. 
Here, the payload is encrypted in 8.t le 
If we analyze EQNEDT32.exe overwritten to recognise the payload, we have the same technics anti emulation with the same value. In a thread, the process posts in a queue the value 5ACE8D0Ah. 

Anti emulation tricks 

Anti emulation tricks 
The verication is calling GetMessage() and the value is stored in EAX in the function sub_401A60. 
The comparaison is made in the calling function sub_4027D0. 

Anti emulation tricks veriation 
Juste after we found again the loop of decryption for the cong. 

call to loop of decryption Loop of decrypting cong 

It¡¯s the same algorithm described: a simple XOR loop with rolling key. 
The mechanism of persistent is the same with a service creation just after dropping dierents les and a privilege escalation. 

We found the same name of the dll les. 

Persistence and loading agent 
The malware overwrite the comobject 
{9BA05972-F6A8¨C11CF-A442¨C00A0C90A8F39} to execute when this com object is called to make a persistence 


ComObject Adding 
All evidences show is the same payload Sisfader RAT. 
Threat Intel 
The toolset for exploiting the module of equation is the same using of the compromission for Vietnameses Ocials used by Goblin Panda. (APT 1937CN) If we check the domain contacted by EQNEDT32.exe is kmbk8.hicp.net. This address is a real good pivot. It makes the link with Goblin Panda and SisFader RAT. 
And the infrastructure is very interesting this domains resolved on three IPs: 
122.158.140.100, 122.158.140.100 and 103.255.45.200 
Theses addresses can permit to found others domains: 
Sd123.eicp.net with new IP 180.131.58.9 and cv3sa.gicp.net with new IP 1.188.233.201 

Infrastructure 
The Ip Address 103.255.45.200 has two domains: www.36106g.com 
36106g.com 

Infrastructure 
All infrastructure is based at Shanghai. The victims are dierent than the Vietnameses campaign. They targeted Telecom Firms pretending to be the Intelligence Service 
of Russia (FSB) 

So Gobelin Panda targets like the report of CrowdStrike https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-
266/images/ReportGlobalThreatIntelligence.pdf 
he telecom industries in Russia. 

Conclusion 
Goblin Panda used Sisfader RAT to target the Telecom Firms russian with the same exploitation techniques for Vietnameses Ocials. They updated theirs technics than the report of NCC group.
