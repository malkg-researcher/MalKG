In the earlier case, the group collected targeted ActiveXobjects on users＊ Internet Explorer browser before they used the zero-day exploit. This was possibly part of their reconnaissance strategy, to find the right targets for their exploit. Based on this, we believe it＊s likely that the new targeted ActiveXobjects we found could be their next targets for a watering hole exploit attack. To help prevent any damage, we decided to publish our findings before the group deploys the attack.

Korean local government labor union websites. This reconnaissance lasted until 27 June. We already notified the websites about the compromise. 
We believe that the injected script came fromthe Andariel group since the code has similar obfuscation and structure to the sample we previously found fromthem. The script was used to collect information fromvisitors＊ browser: browser type, systemlanguage, Flash Player version, Silverlight version, and multiple ActiveXobjects. 
The original script is fromthe PluginDetect Library, and it was also used by exploit kits to verify victims before an attack. The verification process included sending collected information to another compromised website that hosted their PHP programand was designed to receive the information. 
Figure 2. Compromised website injected with malicious script that collects information 
Our colleagues fromthe IssueMakersLab teamshared insights and information about the Andariel group, including that they attacked ActiveXvulnerabilities as far back as 2007. The team monitoring Andariel found that the cybercriminal group injected a malicious script on a South Korean think tank website for reconnaissance in January 2017 and then switched to inject an ActiveXzero-day exploit in mid-April. IssueMakersLab also listed the ActiveXobjects that the Andariel group attacked. 
During analysis, we noticed that the newinjected script was trying to detect two additional ActiveX objects that were not on the previous list. One is ※DSDOWNCTRL.DSDownCtrlCtrl.1§, which is related to a DRM(Digital Rights Management) software froma South Korean Document Protection Security vendor. Another is ※WSACTIVEBRIDGEAX.WSActiveBridgeAXCtrl.1§, which is related to a South Korea-based voice conversion software company. Many local governments and public institutions use these software. 
We made a table to compare the information that the script samples collected in the previous case and this more recent case.

* detection of the previous ActiveX zero-day object ** detection of the ActiveX object related to DRM software (one of the new targets) *** detection of the ActiveX object related to voice conversion software (one of the new targets) **** detection of the WebSocket related to voice conversion software (one of the new targets) 
Table 1. Comparison of the information collected by the previous and new script 
Besides the ActiveXobjects, we noticed that the script added newcode to connect websocket to localhost. The voice conversion software has websocket service listening on the local host so the injected script can detect the software by checking if they can establish a connection to ports 45461 and 45462, which the software uses. 
In addition, the verification process in the older script is different fromthe ActiveXdetection, which was only for the Internet Explorer browser. In the script found in June, the websocket verification could also be performed on other browsers like Chrome and Firefox. This shows that the attacker has expanded his target base, and is interested in the software itself and not just their ActiveX objects. Based on this change, we can expect themto start using attack vectors other than ActiveX.

Reconnaissance is the stage where attackers collect information frompotential targets to help themdetermine what tactics will work. These newdevelopments fromthe Andariel group give us an idea of their plans, although we cannot make specific assumptions about their strategy. 
To stay one step ahead of threats like this, we recommend that people use layered security protection in their environments. Trend Micro endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro. Smart Protection Suites and Worry-Free. Business Security can protect users and businesses from similar threats by detecting malicious files and spammed messages as well as blocking all related malicious URLs. Trend Micro Deep Discovery. has an email inspection layer that can protect enterprises by detecting malicious attachment and URLs.
