Chafer: Latest Attacks Reveal Heightened Ambitions 
Iran-based group remains highly active and is moving up the telecoms and transport supply chain to facilitate widescale surveillance of targets. 
Chafer, the Iran-based targeted attack group, mounted further operations throughout 2017, attacking more organizations in the Middle East and beyond, and deploying several new tools. The group staged a number of ambitious new attacks last year, including the compromise of a major telecoms services provider in the region. There is also evidence that it attempted to attack a major international travel reservations rm. Chafer appears to be primarily engaged in surveillance and tracking of individuals, with most of its attacks likely carried out to gather information on targets or facilitate surveillance. 
Chafer has been active since at least July 2014 and its activities were rst exposed by Symantec in December 2015 
(https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/iran-based-attackers-use-back-door-threats-spy-middle-eastern-targets), when it was found to be conducting targeted surveillance of domestic and international targets. At the time, many of its targets were individuals located in Iran, and it had already begun compromising telecom providers as well as airline companies in the Middle East region.

Expansion of operations 
Chafer appears to have been undeterred by its exposure in 2015 and continued to be very active during 2017, using seven new tools, rolling out new infrastructure, and attacking nine new target organizations in the region. The group hit organizations in Israel, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. 
Sectors targeted included airlines; aircraft services; software and IT services companies serving the air and sea transport sectors; telecoms services; payroll services; engineering consultancies; and document management software. 
Outside of the Middle East, Symantec has also found evidence of attacks against one African airline and attempts to compromise an international travel reservations rm. 

Ambitious new targets 
One of the organizations compromised by Chafer in 2017 was a telecoms services provider in the Middle East, which sells its solutions to multiple telecoms operators in the region. The ultimate goal of the attack may have been to facilitate surveillance of end-user customers of telecoms operators. By moving two steps up the supply chain the attackers could potentially have carried out surveillance on a vast pool of end-users. 
Alongside evidence of compromise of the organization itself, Symantec also found a copy of one of the company¡¯s own les, relating to its messaging software, on a staging server used by Chafer. The le was in a directory alongside a number of hacking tools used by the attackers. 
A second target outside the Middle East provides further conrmation of Chafer¡¯s heightened ambitions in recent times. Symantec found evidence that it had tried to compromise a large international travel reservations rm. There was no indication that the attack was successful, but Chafer did successfully inltrate an African airline that is a customer of the reservations rm.

Symantec also discovered multiple IP addresses that were used as infrastructure by the attackers. It is unclear whether these were leased or hijacked, but the fact that many of them appear to follow a pattern¡ªwith the latter three numbers of each address often running in sequence¡ªmakes it likely they were deliberately selected by the attackers. 

107.191.62[.]45 94.100.21[.]213 89.38.97[.]112.148.251.197[.]113 83.142.230[.]113 87.117.204[.]113.89.38.97[.]115.87.117.204[.]115 185.22.172[.]40 92.243.95[.]203 91.218.114[.]204 86.105.227[.]224.91.218.114[.]225 134.119.217[.]84 













In one case, Symantec found what appeared to be a staging server used by the attackers. The server belonged to one of the targeted organizations. Copies of many of the tools used by the group were discovered on the server. The attackers didn¡¯t even bother hiding their activity and saved items to the desktop, often without renaming them. 
Links to Crambus? 
Chafer¡¯s activities have some links to another group known as Crambus (aka Oilrig). Both groups have been observed using the same IP address for command and control purposes. In addition to this, both groups have been seen using a similar infection vector, namely an Excel document which drops a malicious VBS le. Both VBS les reference the same le path, containing the same misspelling: 

¡°schtasks.exe /create/ F /sc minute /mo 2 /tn "UpdatMachine" /tr %LOCALAPPDATA%\microsoft\Feed\Y658123.vbs¡± 
Are the two groups one and the same? While this may be a possibility, at present there isn¡¯t enough evidence to support that hypothesis. What is more likely is that the two groups are known to each other and enjoy access to a shared pool of resources. 
Growing threat to organizations in the Middle East 
Chafer¡¯s recent activities indicate that the group remains highly active, is continuing to hone its tools and tactics, and has become more audacious in its choice of targets. Although a regional actor, the group has followed two trends seen globally among targeted attack groups. The rst is a greater reliance on freely available software tools, also known as ¡°living off the land.¡± By limiting their use of malware, groups such as Chafer hope to be less conspicuous on a victim¡¯s network and, if discovered, make their attack more dicult to attribute. 
The second trend is towards attacks on the supply chain, compromising organizations with the goal of then attacking the customers, or even the customers of the customers, of those organizations. These attacks require more ¡°steps¡± to reach their ultimate target, which adds additional time and risk for attackers to reach their targets.. However these attacks also leverage trusted channels into the eventual target, e.g., through a trusted supplier, allowing attackers to potentially circumvent security systems at the organization they ultimately wish to compromise. These attacks are riskier but come with a potentially higher reward and, if successful, could give the attackers access to a vast pool of potential targets..
