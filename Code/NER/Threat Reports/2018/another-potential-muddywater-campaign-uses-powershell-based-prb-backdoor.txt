As mentioned earlier, our analysis of the sample revealed characteristics that likely connect it to the MuddyWater campaign, in particular: 

The 
delivery method, which involves the use of a malicious document with an embedded macro as a lure for potential victims 


The 
obfuscation method for the macro scripts, which will result in an intended backdoor payload. This method is commonly used in samples that were used in the MuddyWater campaign

Technical details 
The sample we analyzed was a Word document used as a lure for unsuspecting victims. However, unlike the samples fromthe previous campaigns, the lure document deals with a different subject matter. Instead of using government or telecommunications-related documents, the newlure document presents itself as a reward or promotion, which could indicate that the targets are no longer limited to specific industries or organizations.

The code inside the GREEN boxmanipulates the images shown in the document¡¯s body. The code inside the BLUE boxconstructs the main Powershell commands and scripts. These will be executed to performthe main routine.

Decoding and deobfuscation 
Analysis of the code revealed a PowerShell script capable of decoding the contents of the malicious document, which results in the execution of yet another encoded PowerShell script.

PDFmyURLconvertsanyurltopdf!Figure 6. The second encoded PowerShell script, which is executed after the first script is decoded 
This will then result in more readable PowerShell scripts capable of dropping various components in the %Application Data%\Microsoft\CLR\* directory. The main PowerShell file invoker.ps1 uses these components to run the final payload, PRB-Backdoor, previously analyzed by other security researchers in May 2018.

PRB-Backdoor is a backdoor that takes its name fromthe function used in the final PowerShell script payload, as seen in the figure below.

The backdoor communicates with its Command-and-Control (C&C server), hxxp://outl00k[.]net, to send and receive the following commands: 
PDFmyURLconvertsanyurltopdf!Command  Details  
PRB-CREATEALIVE  Initializes connection with the C&C Server  
PRB-CREATEINTRODUCE  Registers/introduces the affected machine to the C&C server  
PRB-History  Gather browsing histories from different browsers and send it to the C&C server using the ¡°sendfile¡± function  
PRB-PASSWORD  Steals passwords listed or found in the browser histories  
PRB-READFILE  Reads files  
PRB-WRITEFILE  Writes files  
PRB-Shell  Executes shell commands  
PRB-Logger  Calls the ¡°Logger¡± function, used to record keyboard strokes  
PRB-Shot  Triggers the SNAP function, used to capture screenshots  
PRB-funcupdate  Updates functions  
sysinfo  Gathers system information  
Start_Dns  Initializes DNS Session/Connection  

If these samples are indeed related to MuddyWater, this means that the threat actors behind MuddyWater are continuously evolving their tools and techniques to make themmore effective and persistent. 

Countermeasures and Trend Micro Solutions 
Given the use of lure documents designed with social engineering in mind, it is likely that the attackers use phishing or spamto target users who are unaware of these documents¡¯ malicious nature. Awareness can effectively mitigate or stop these kinds of attacks frombeing successful. The first step is to be able to identify phishing attacks and distinguish legitimate emails from malicious ones. Telltale signs of social engineering include ¡°too-good-to-be-true¡± offers and messages that lack context. In general, users should always practice caution when it comes to email. This includes avoiding clicking on links or downloading any documents unless certain that these are legitimate.
