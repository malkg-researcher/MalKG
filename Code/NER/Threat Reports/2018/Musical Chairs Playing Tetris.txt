Musical Chairs Playing Tetris

on February 15, 
2018. (https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/2018/02/) 

February 20, 2018: This blog has been amended since it was originally published on February 15, 2018. This version removes the association with the APT group responsible for the Night Dragon campaign that we had incorrectly made. We thank the research team at Palo Alto Networks 
(https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-research) for graciously 
bringing this to our attention. 
Introduction 
ASERT has discovered new command-and-control infrastructure controlled by the actors behind the Musical Chairs campaign..The actors are known for the longevity of their C2 domains, reusing them long after they have been identied, and for making use of a popular opened sourced RAT called Gh0st..Uniquely in our observation, they have even embedded a fully-functional version of the game Tetris that will launch only when a special condition is meet. 

Key Findings 

ASERT
 has discovered a new domain associated with the actors behind the Musical Chairs campaign. 


This
 long-standing actor is known for maintaining static command-and-control infrastructure such as domains for long periods of time, even when they have been discovered and widely publicized in the community. 


With
 moderate condence, ASERT expects this domain to be used in new intrusions. 


Multiple (http://malware-unplugged.blogspot.com/2015/01/hunting-and-
decrypting-communications.html) 
articles (https://www.sans.org/reading-
room/whitepapers/detection/gh0st-dshell-decoding-undocumented-protocols-
37032) have been written about Gh0st over the years, including this one 
discussing the Musical Chairs campaign 
(https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/09/musical-chairs-multi-

year-campaign-involving-new-variant-of-gh0st-malware/)¡®s use of this RAT.. Using

details from that report, ASERT has identi.ed a new sample and moreINFORMATION) 
interestingly, a new domain that we have associated with the 
corresponding actor. 
(https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/wp-
content/uploads/2018/02/domain_tools_etybh_com.png) 
The sample appears to be delivered via an email according to artifacts provided 
by malware-trac-analysis (http://www.malware-trac-
analysis.net/2018/01/04/index.html), which is consistent with documented tactics 
for this group (https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/09/musical-
chairs-multi-year-campaign-involving-new-variant-of-gh0st-malware/). 
Gh0st variants are prolic as they can be found in a popular open-source source 
code repository ¨C this blog provides the basis for our association with the actor. 
Analysis 
Malware 
Example of this Gh0st¡¯s init/login packet (notice ¡®aaaaabbbbb¡¯ which can be usedto identify this variant):UNDERATTACK?CALL(844)END.DDOS(HTTPS://WWW.ARBORNETWORKS.COM/OFFICE-CONTACT-INFORMATION)(https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gh0st_pcap.png) Some other behavior of interest observed while reviewing this actor¡¯s specimen is they appear to be moving away from BAT and JS les as part of the infection process[i] to using DLL side loading.. This is just one sample though, so take this for what it is..As part of the DLL side-loading, they make use of a signed executable to load a DLL which in turn is used to launch the actual Gh0st DLL. They are not the only malware authors who use this trick. The observed functionality in this sample maps directly to public documentation for Gh0st, so this blog will not rehash that. 
Association No. 1 
Starting with the known C2 servers for this group, we can check to see if the new domain has any ties to them..Two of their C2s were registered back in 2013 and the campaign has been around even longer than that per Known Domains 

yourbroiler[.]com meitanjiaoyiwang[.]com 

New Domain etybh[.]com 

Looking at DomainTools, we learn that all three share the same IP, 45.34.148.126, and the same registrar, Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. LTD.

The newest domain, etybh[.]com, was registered in December of 2017..Looking 
at PassiveTotal, all three domains appeared to have switched from 
98.126.223.218 to 45.34.148.146 sometime in the middle of January 2018..This is 
our rst clue that they are related. 
Association 
No. 
2 
This one comes from looking at behavior when the le is attached to a debugger. 
First, let us back up a step..Observing behaviors of our suspected Musical Chairs 
Gh0st sample via a sandbox, we see that it creates a folder called ¡°Win32Tetris¡±..Let¡¯s see if there are any other Gh0st samples that do this as well..Taking a look 
through ASERT¡¯s malware corpus we nd this sample, 
11fe12bbb479b4562c1f21a74e09b233ed41c41b7c4c0cad736924672fb86a, 
which also creates that folder..Using clues left by another researcher[ii], we can 
conrm that this more recent sample.is from the Musical Chairs group due to the 
C2 and some other characteristics we¡¯ll go over..The most promising correlation 
is that this sample¡¯s C2 is www.yourbroiler[.]com which is a known C2 for this 
actor..Next, we nd similarities from a dierent dropped le called 
C:\microsoft\lib\ki\vv.js whose content reads as such: 
(https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/wp-
content/uploads/2018/02/vv_js_snippet.png) 
The content is similar to samples identied back in 2015[iii], which also used 
rundll32 to call a mystart method..And, nally, this sample makes use of the 
same mutex tied to this actor¡¯s Gh0st variant: dafewewrw. 
UNDERATTACK?CALL(844)END.DDOS(HTTPS://WWW.ARBORNETWORKS.COM/OFFICE-CONTACT-INFORMATION)To summarize the pivot sample  
Property  Value  
Load the dll via a script .le called  C:\microsoft\lib\ki\vv.js  
Domain  www.yourbroiler[.]com  
Mutex  dafewewrw  

Now that we have conrmed that this sample appears to be a Musical Chairs actor Gh0st variant, let¡¯s work the pivot (going to refer to this sample as the ¡°pivot¡± sample). The pivot sample, when attached to a debugger, will launch what appears to be a fully functional Tetris game (very friendly of them to provide us reverse engineers with a short break):

(HTTPS://WWW.ARBORNETWORKS.COM/OFFICE-CONTACT-The latest sample (the one tied to the new domain, etybh[.]com) also exhibits thisINFORMATION)same behavior when attached to the debugger..To play the game make sure to 
not hide the PEB..For what it is worth, after checking out one of the prior samples from 2015[iv], it exhibited similar behavior; just not a Tetris game.

Association No. 3 
The nal observation is the fact that the payload dropped on the le system as RasTls.dat is in fact an obfuscated DLL le..When looking at the DLL properties the mystart function is exported..Again, mystart is the exported DLL function which the samples back in 2015 called.

Conclusion 
While it should not surprise us when a long-standing actor switches things up, 
this specic actor is known for not really changing much..The use of a dierent 
Gh0st variant in addition to the new domain may be indicative of additional 
changes coming or the actor may be just keeping up with the times. Given 
previously observed behavior, it is likely that this indicator will be used in the 
campaign for the foreseeable future and ASERT is making it available to enable 
visibility for the broader security research community.
