Attackers are starting to invest in long-termoperations that target specific processes enterprises rely on. They scout for vulnerable practices, susceptible systems and operational loopholes that they can leverage or abuse. To learn more, read ourSecurity101:

Dropper analysis 
The dropper is used to install the backdoor into the infected systemand establish its persistence. 
Figure 4. The main function of the dropper 
All strings within the dropper, as well as the backdoor, are encrypted using a hardcoded RSA256 key. There are two forms of encrypted strings: an RSA256-encrypted string, and custombase64-encoded and RSA256-encrypted string. 
ConvertwebpagesorentirewebsitestoPDFPDFmyURL!Figure 5. Hardcoded RSA256 key showing the first 20 characters 
Using the setStartup() method, the dropper first checks if it is running as a root or not. Based on that, the GET_PROCESSPATH and GET_PROCESSNAME methods will decrypt the hardcoded path and filename where the backdoor should be installed. The locations: 

For root user 
path: /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/FCP-DAL/iOSScreenCapture.plugin/Contents/Resources/ processname: screenassistantd 

For regular user 
path: ~/Library/Spelling/ processname: spellagentd 
Subsequently, it implements the Loader::installLoader method, reading the hardcoded 64-bit Mach-O executable (magic value 0xFEEDFACF), and writing to the previously determined path and file.

~/Library/LaunchAgents/ filename.plist > /dev/nul will then command the operating systemto start the dropped backdoor file at login. The dropper will delete itself at the end of the process. 
Backdoor analysis 
The main loop of the backdoor has two main functions, infoClient and runHandle. infoClient is reponsible for collecting OS info, submitting this info to its C&C servers (the servers are malicious in nature), and receiving additional C&C communication information. Meanwhile, runHandle is responsible for the backdoor capabilities. 
Figure 9. The main functions of the backdoor infoClient fills up the variables in HandlePP class. 

clientID is an MD5 hash derived fromthe environment variables, while strClientID is a hexadecimal representation of clientID. All strings beloware encrypted via AES256 and base64 encoding. The HandlePP::getClientID method uses the following environment variables: 
Figure 11. Serial number 

Figure 12. Hardware UUID 
Figure 13. MAC address 
Figure 14. Randomly generated UUID 
For the initial information packet, the backdoor also collects the following: 
Figure 15. OS version Running getpwuid ->pw_name , scutil 每 -get ComputerName, and uname 每m will provide the following returns respectively: Mac OSX10.12. 


SystemAdministrator 

<owner＊s name>＊s iMac x86_64 

All these data are scrambled and encrypted before sending to the C&C server. The process is detailed below: 
1. Scrambling 
Class Parser has several methods, one for each variable type 每 Parser::inBytes, Parser::inByte, Parser::inString, and Parser::inInt. 
Figure 16. Parser::inBytes method 
If clientID equals the following sequence of bytes B4 B1 47 BC 52 28 28 73 1F 1A 01 6B FA 72 C0 73, then the scrambled version is computed using the third parameter (0x10), which is treated as a DWORD. Each quadruple of bytes is XOR-ed with it, as shown in example below. 
ConvertwebpagesorentirewebsitestoPDFPDFmyURL!ConvertwebpagesorentirewebsitestoPDFPDFmyURL!Figure 17. Parser::inByte method 
When scrambling one byte, the scrambler first determines if the byte value is odd or even. If the value is odd, it adds the byte, along with one more randomly generated byte, to the array. In the case of an even value, the randomly generated byte is added first, followed by the byte being added. In the case above, the third parameter is ＆1＊ = 0x31, which is an odd number. This means that it adds byte ＆1＊ and one randomly generated byte to the final scrambled array. 
Figure 18. Parser::inString method 
When scrambling a string, the scrambler generates a 5-byte long sequence. First, it generates one randombyte, followed by three zero bytes, one randombyte, and finally, the byte with the length of the string. Let＊s say we want to scramble string ＆Mac OSX10.12.＊ Its length is 13 = 0x0d, andthe two randombytes are 0xf3 and0x92. The final5-byte sequence looks like F300000092 0D. The original string is then XOR＊ed with the 5-byte sequence. 
Figure 19. Scrambling ＆Mac OSX 10.12＊ 
2. Encryption 
The scrambled byte sequence is passed onto the constructor of the class Packet::Packet, which creates a randomAES256 key and encrypts the buffer with this key. 
3. Encoding the encryption key In order for the C&C server to decrypt the encrypted data, the randomly generated AES256 key 
must be included in the packet along with the encrypted data. However, this key is also scrambled with operation XOR 0x13 followed by ROL 6 operation applied to each byte. 
Figure 20. Function for scrambling AES256 key in the outgoing packet 
Some screenshots taken during scrambling and encryption process: 

Figure 22. Randomly generated AES256 key 

Figure 24. Computer info encrypted with AES256 key 


Figure 25. Screenshot of the final payload to be sent to C&C server. The scrambled AES256 key is marked green, while the encrypted computer info is marked red. Other bytes are just randomly generated noise. 
When the backdoor receives the response fromthe C&C server, the final payload needs to be decoded again in a similar manner via decryption and scrambling. Packet::getData decrypts the received payload and Converter::outString descrambles the result. 
The received data fromthe C&C server include the following information: 
HandlePP::urlRequest (/appleauth/static/cssj/N252394295/widget/auth/app.css) HandlePP::keyDecrypt STRINGDATA::BROWSER_SESSION_ID (m_pixel_ratio) STRINGDATA::RESOURCE_ID 
These data will be later used in the C&C communication, as shown in the Wireshark screenshot below. 

Meanwhile, the runHandle method of the main backdoor loop will call for the requestServer method with the following backdoor commands (each command has one byte long code and is extracted by Packet::getCommand): 
Figure 27. The getCommand method 
The figure belowshows the example of two of several possible command codes. Both create one thread, and each thread is responsible for either downloading and executing the file or running a command line programin the terminal:

Mitigation 
Malicious attacks targeting Mac devices are not as common as its counterparts, but the discovery of this newMacOS backdoor that is presumably distributed via phishing email calls for every user to adopt best practices for phishing attacks regardless of operating system. 
End users can benefit fromsecurity solutions such as Trend Micro Home Security for Mac, which provides comprehensive security and multi-device protection against cyberthreats. Enterprises can benefit fromTrend Micro＊s Smart Protection Suites with XGen. security, which infuses high-fidelity machine learning into a blend of threat protection techniques to eliminate security gaps across any user activity and any endpoint.
