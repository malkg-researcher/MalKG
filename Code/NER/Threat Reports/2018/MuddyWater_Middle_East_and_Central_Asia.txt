We discovered a new campaign targeting organizations in Turkey, Pakistan and Tajikistan that hassome similarities with an earlier campaign named MuddyWater, which hit various industries inseveral countries, primarily in the Middle East and Central Asia. Third party security researchersnamed the MuddyWater campaign as such because of the dif.culties in attributing the attacks.However, given the nature of the targets, as well as the gathering and uploading of information toC&C servers, it appears that the attackers are mainly concerned with espionage activities ¡ª withthe Saudi Arabia¡¯s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) publishing an alert on their website regarding the attacks. 
Given the number of similarities, we can assume that there is a connection between these new attacks and the MuddyWater campaign. It also signi.es that the attackers are not merely interestedin a one-off campaign, but will likely continue to perform cyberespionage activities against thetargeted countries and industries. 
Comparing the earlier MuddyWater campaign with this new one reveals some distinct similiarities:

In addition to the common characteristics seen above, the campaigns also use similar obfuscationprocesses, as are the internal variables after deobfuscation. A list of isDebugEnv is also present inboth campaigns.

Our research found malicious delivery documents (Detected by Trend Micro asJS_VALYRIA.DOCT and W2KM_VALYRIA.DOCT) containing text and .le names in the Tajiklanguage attempting to target individuals working for government organizations andtelecommunication companies in Tajikistan. Each document uses social engineering to trickpotential victims into clicking it to enable the macros and activate the payload. While some of thepayloads we observed were embedded inside the document itself, some of the payloads were alsodownloaded from the internet after the lure was clicked.There is a separate lure with a program keygenerator written in Java that was bundled with a Java downloader. However, the actual payload isthe same. 
Some examples of the lure documents used in the campaign can be seen below:

Note that it uses the Tajikistan emblem,signifying that this is likely used to target government organizations or make it seem that it camefrom oneFigure 3.

After enabling the macros and the payload executes, two .les ¨C an obfuscated Visual Basic script (Detected by Trend Micro as VBS_VALYRIA.DOCT), and an obfuscated PowerShell script(Detected by Trend Mico as TROJ_VALYRIA.PS) ¡ª are created in the ProgramData directoryplaced in randomly-named directories. The purpose of the .VBS script is to execute the PowerShellscript. The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler as a form of persistence. 
In other campaigns, two .les are also dropped. One of them is the VBS script, however, the second.le is a base64 encoded text .le, which, after decoding, results in the Powershell .le, as in theprevious campaign. This is one simple layer of obfuscation, likely to avoid some antivirusdetections. 
The latest change, drops three .les ¨C an.sct scriptlet .le, an.inf .le and a base64 encoded data .le.The scriptlet .le and inf .le use publicly available code for bypassing applockerCode examples arealso available on github. 
The PowerShell script, which employs several layers of obfuscation, is divided into three parts. 
Part one contains global variables like paths, encryption keys, a list of a few hundred gates orhacked websites which serve as proxies: Oracle Server VulnerabilityExploited to Deliver DoubleMonero Miner Payloads

The second part contains functions related to the encryption, which is a standard RSA encryptionwith very small keys. 
The third part contains the backdoor function. This function will .rst collect machine informationand take screenshots before it sends this data to a command-and-control (C&C) server whilewaiting for commands. These include the following actions: clean, reboot, shutdown, screenshot,and upload. 
The clean command attempts to recursively delete all the items from drives C, D, E, and F. 
Figure 7. The clean command wipes drives C, D, E and F 
C&C Communication 
The communication is done via XML messages with the following supported ACTION commands: 

REGISTER IMAGE 


COMMAND RESULT UPLOAD The backdoor .rst .nds out the machine IP address by querying the internet serviceapi[.]ipify[.]org, which returns the IP address of the currently infected machine. This IP address isthen fed to another internet service called apinotes[.]com, which returns the location information ofthe given IP address. 

The backdoor then collects the system information about the infected machine such as theOperating System name, architecture, domain, network adapter con.guration, and username. It thenseparates each piece of information with **, and sends this system info as part of the REGISTER message: 
Figure 8. The register message before encryption 
A simple RSA algorithm with very small keys encrypts the message seen above. Let¡¯s take the .rstcharacter as an example. Character ¡°{¡± = 0x7B =123. Variable ${prIVATE} = 959, 713 fromsection 1 of the PowerShell script has two values; the .rst number is the key and the secondnumber is the modulus. By computing (123 ^ 959) mod 713 = 340 we get the encrypted value ofthe .rst character (see number 340 in the .gure below). The message above gets encrypted asshown in .gure 9 below, then its contents are sent via post request to one of many hacked gates. 
Figure 9. The register message after encryption 
The response to this message is another set of decimal numbers which can be decrypted by thepublic key, which is stored in ${pUbLIC} = 37, 437 variable in part 1 of the PowerShell script. 
Figure 10. The encrypted response to the register message 
The message above can be decrypted to: 
{¡°STATUS¡±: ¡°OK¡±, ¡°TOKEN¡±: ¡°d02153ffaf8137b1fa3bb852a27a12f8¡±} 
The XML message containing screenshot can be seen below. Note that the previously obtainedSYSID that serves as a machine identi.er, ACTION:¡±IMAGE¡± tells us that a base64 encoded image will be followed in IMAGE .eld. 
Figure 11. The XML message with the screenshot 
It seems that the attackers are actively monitoring the incoming connections to the C&C. In one ofour attempts, we sent an improper request to the C&C server, which replied with the followingmessage: ¡°Stop!!! I Kill You Researcher.¡± This level of personalized messaging implies that theattackers are monitoring what data is going to and from their C&C server. 
Figure 12. When the threat actor discovers the researcher via an improper request 
Another hidden message or a false .ag? 
For the PowerShell script, the .rst part contains a variable named dragon_middle, which is an arraycontaining a few hundred URLs ending with connection.php that serve as proxies between victimand C&C. If communication with C&C fails, and if the PowerShell script is run from a commandline, a few error messages written in simpli.ed Mandarin Chinese are displayed, with a curiousphrase that translates to ¡°waiting for dragon¡±:

ÎÞ·¨·ÃÎÊ±¾µØ¼ÆËã»ú¼Ä´æÆ÷ (Unable to access local computer register)

ÈÎÎñ¼Æ»®³ÌÐò·ÃÎÊ±»¾Ü¾ø (Mission Scheduler access is denied)

ÎÞ·¨Á¬½Óµ½ÍøÖ·£¬ÇëµÈ´ýÁú (Cannot connect to URL, please wait for dragon)

ÎÞ·¨Á¬½Óµ½ÍøÖ·£¬ÇëµÈ´ýÁú (Cannot connect to website, please wait for dragon)These messages may not reveal anything about the real attackers as the malware writers sometimeslike to embed false .ags into their programs to confuse researchers. The syntax and grammarsuggest that the language could have been machine-translated rather than written by a nativespeaker. 

Countermeasures and Trend Micro Solutions 
Users unfamiliar with the various kinds of social engineering techniques might .nd it dif.cult todistinguish a legitimate message from a malicious one ¨C thus the need for education on identifyingand mitigating phishing attacks ¨C especially if it involves organizations in sensitive industries suchas government and manufacturing. Context, in this case, is important. Users need to consider why 
they received an email and avoid clicking on any links or attachments in general until they arecertain that they are legitimate.
