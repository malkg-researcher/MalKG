On May 29th, we identi.ed an attack that we believe is part of a new campaign from an Advanced Persistent Threat actor known as Higaisa. The Higaisa APT is believed to be tied to the Korean peninsula, and was .rst disclosed by Tencent Security Threat Intelligence Center in early 2019. 
The group＊s activities go back to at least 2016 and include the use of Trojans such as Gh0st and PlugX, as well as mobile malware. Its targets include government of.cials and human rights organizations, as well as other entities related to North Korea. 
In this latest incident, Higaisa used a malicious shortcut .le ultimately responsible for creating a multi-stage attack that consists of several malicious scripts, payloads and decoy PDF documents. 
Distribution 
The threat actors used a malicious LNK .le bundled within an archive .le which was most likely distributed via spear-phishing. 
We were able to identify two variants of this campaign that possibly have been distributed between May 12th and 31st: 

※CV_Colliers.rar§ 

※Project link and New copyright policy.rar§ 
Both RAR archives bundle two malicious LNK .les. In the newer variant (CV_Colliers.rar), the LNK .les are disguised as a Curriculum Vitae (CV) and International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam results. The older one (Project link and New copyright policy.rar) seems to target 
product 
teams 
that 
are 
using 
zeplin.io. 

The following shows the overall process .ow when executing the malicious LNK .le. 
Figure 1: Process graph 

LNK .le 
The LNK .le contains a list of commands that will be executed upon running, and a blob that is a base64 encoded compressed payload. Here is the list of commands that will be executed: 
Figure 2: Malicious lnk commands 

Copy 
content of the LNK .le into ※g4ZokyumB2DC4.tmp§ in %APPDATA% temp directory. 


Copy 
content of ※certutil.exe§ into ※gosia.exe§ ( ※*ertu*.exe is used to bypass security detection). 


Look 
for the base64 blob using ※.ndstr.exe§ and write it to ※cSi1rouy4.tmp§. 


Decode 
content of ※cSi1rouy4.tmp§ using ※gosia.exe -decode§ (certutil.exe -decode) and write it to ※o423DFDS4.tmp§. 


Decompress 
content of ※o423DFDS4.tmp§ in temp directory along with a decoy PDF document using ※expand.exe -F:*§ (Figure 3) . 


Copy 
※66DF33DFG.tmp§ and ※34fDKfSD38.js§ .les into ※C:\Users\Public\Downloads§ directory. 


Execute 
the JS .le by calling Wscript. 


Open 
the decoy document.

The list of commands executed by this LNK shortcut is the same as the one reported by Anomali on 
the 
Higasia 
Covid-19 
campaign. 
The only difference is the name of the tmp .les and name of certutil.exe which in this new case is ※gosia.exe§, while in the March campaign the name was ※mosia.exe§. 
Both LNK .les embedded within the archive are executing similar commands with the different Command and Control (C&C) con.gurations. Running each of them would show a different decoy document.

JS .le 
The JavaScript .le performs the following commands: 

Create 
※d3reEW.exe§ in ※C:\Users\Public\Downloads§ and store ※cmd /c ipcon.g§ in it. 


Execute 
the dropped ※svchast.exe§. 


Copy 
※svchhast.exe§ into startup directory and rename it as ※of.ceupdate.exe§. 


Add 
※of.ceupdate.exe§ to scheduled tasks. 


Send 
a POST request to a hardcoded URL with ※d3reEW.exe§ as data.

Figure7: POST request 

svchast.exe 
Svchast.exe is a small loader that loads the content of the shellcode stored in ※63DF3DFG.tmp§. 
Figure 8: Main function of svchast.exe 
In fact, this shellcode is a wrapper around the .nal shellcode. It performs some checks and then calls the .nal shellcode. 
Figure 9: Calling .nal shellcode 
The .nal shellcode dynamically resolves the imports and allocates memory for the content that will be executed.

memory

thread 
Finally it calls ※CreateThread§ to create a thread within its memory space to make HTTPS requests to its C&C server.

At the time of analysis, the server was down so we weren＊t able to clearly identify the ultimate goal of this attack. 

Chaining techniques for evasion 
While most malware campaigns use a simple decoy document that typically retrieves a malware payload, more advanced attackers will often try unconventional means to infect their victims. 
We reproduced this attack in our lab using an email as the infection vector, as we surmise that victims were spear-phished. Malwarebytes 
(in 
this 
case 
the 
Nebula 
business 
version) 
stopped 
the 
LNK .le execution from WinRAR and therefore completely stopped the attack.
