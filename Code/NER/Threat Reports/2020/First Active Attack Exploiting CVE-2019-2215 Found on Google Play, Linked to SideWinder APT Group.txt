group that has been active since 2012, is a known threat and has reportedly targeted military entities¡¯ 
Windows machines. 

0by.Ecular Xu and Joseph C Chenattack in the wild that uses the Willyoutakeafewmomentstoanswerafewques©\tionssurroundingyourblogpreferences?STARTThe three malicious apps were disguised as photography and .le manager tools. We speculate that these appshave been active since March 2019 based on the certi.cate information on one of the apps. The apps havesince been removed from Google Play.

Installation 

Figure 3. Parsed C&C Server address 
After this step, the downloaded DEX .le downloads an APK .le and installs it after exploiting the device oremploying accessibility. All of this is done without user awareness or intervention. To evade detection, it usesmany techniques such as obfuscation, data encryption, and invoking dynamic code. 
The apps Camero and FileCrypt Manger act as droppers. After downloading the extra DEX .le from theC&C server, the second-layer droppers invoke extra code to download, install, and launch the callCam app onthe device. 
Willyoutakeafewmomentstoanswerafewques©\tionssurroundingyourblogpreferences?STARTTo deploy the payload app callCam on the device without the user¡¯s awareness, SideWinder does thefollowing: 
1. Device RootingThis approach is done by the dropper app Camero and only works on Google Pixel (Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL),Nokia 3 (TA-1032), LG V20 (LG-H990), Oppo F9 (CPH1881), and Redmi 6A devices. The malwareretrieves a speci.c exploit from the C&C server depending on the DEX downloaded by the dropper. 
Figure 6. Code snippet from Extra DEX downloaded by Camero 
We were able to download .ve exploits from the C&C server during our investigation. They use thevulnerabilities CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU to get root privilege.

After acquiring root privilege, the malware installs the app callCam, enables its accessibility permission, andthen launches it. 
Figure 9. Commands install app, launch app, and enable accessibility 
2. Using the Accessibility PermissionThis approach is used by the dropper app FileCrypt Manager and works on most typical Android phonesabove Android 1.6. After its launch, the app asks the user to enable accessibility.

Once granted, the app shows a full screen window that says that it requires further setup steps. In reality, thatis just an overlay screen that is displayed on top of all activity windows on the device. The overlay windowsets its attributions to FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE and FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE, allowing the activitywindows to detect and receive the users¡¯ touch events through the overlay screen. 

Meanwhile, the app invokes code from the extra DEX .le to enable the installation of unknown apps and theinstallation of the payload app callCam. It also enables the payload app¡¯s accessibility permission, and thenlaunches the payload app. All of this happens behind the overlay screen, unbeknownst to the user. And, allthese steps are performed by employing Accessibility.

callCam¡¯s Activities 
The app callCam hides its icon on the device after being launched. It collects the following information andsends it back to the C&C server in the background:

The app encrypts all stolen data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms. It uses SHA256 to verify dataintegrity and customize the encoding routine. When encrypting, it creates a block of data we namedheadData. This block contains the .rst 9 bytes of origin data, origin data length, random AES IV, the RSA-encrypted AES encrypt key, and the SHA256 value of AES-encrypted origin data. Then the headData isencoded through the customized routine. After the encoding, it is stored in the head of the .nal encrypted .lefollowed by the data of the AES-encrypted original data.

Relation to SideWinder 
These apps may be attributed to SideWinder as the C&C servers it uses are suspected to be part of. In addition, a URL linking to one of the apps¡¯ Google Play pages is also foundSideWinder¡¯s infrastructureon one of the C&C servers.
