May 29, 2020 

Some of the most notorious actors in the cyber threat landscape have been traced back to sponsorship by the Russian state. As the digital revolution has accelerated, so, too, has the Russian cyber attack landscape ¡ª hold-over Cold War tactics that evolved to take advantage of new electronic methods of communication. 
Strategic Russian interests are guided by the desires for Russia to be recognized as a great power, to protect the Russian identity, and to limit global United States power. These themes are evident in components commonly associated with Russian-backed cyber threat campaigns: 

The 
weaponization of information through disinformation campaigns and propaganda 


Attempted 
interference in democratic processes 


Strategic 
positioning within critical infrastructure, perhaps as preparation for potential escalation of hostilities with rival nations. 


To summarize the threat at a more tactical level, we have scoured cybersecurity reporting in order to prepare an overview of cyber threat actors observed more recently, and to which evidence-based analysis has assigned the likelihood of Russian state-sponsorship as probable. Each actor is presented with highlights of more notable campaign activity, with notations on countries and sectors targeted, as well as a mention of behaviors or tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) utilized in order to enable actions on objectives. Footnotes provide links to further, more detailed, reading. 
Who are today¡¯s major Russian adversary groups and what are the main tactics and techniques of Russian cyber attack campaigns? Let¡¯s take a closer look at some of these known actors, listed here in order of threat scope and potential: 
Sandworm Team 
Active 
since 
at 
least 
2009, 
the 
Sandworm 
Team 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
.rst 
publicly 
acknowledged 
cyber 
incident 
that 
resulted 
in 
power 
outages 
impacting 
a 
civilian 
population, 
occurring 
in 
Ukraine 
in December 2015. The malware used in this attack, BlackEnergy 3, enabled the actor to gain access to the IT network of a Ukrainian power company, from which they pivoted to the SCADA portion of the network, giving the actor the ability to manipulate the Industrial Control System (ICS) ¡ª without the need for customized malware ¡ª in order to shut down power in Kiev. This is an often mis-characterized component of the campaign, likely because the BlackEnergy 2 predecessor to BlackEnergy 3 contained ICS targeting components that are not present in BlackEnergy 3. Cybersecurity 
researchers 
also 
note 
that 
¡°Russian operators, such as Sandworm Team, have compromised Western ICS over a multi-year period without causing a disruption,¡± perhaps in order to stage for future potential Russian cyber attack campaigns.

ELECTRUM 
This 
group 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
CRASHOVERRIDE 
malware 
framework 
(frequently 
also 
referred 
to as Industroyer), which was the .rst malware to ever speci.cally target and disrupt electric grid operations. In December 2016, Russian cyber attack by these actors manipulated breakers at a substation in Kiev Ukraine, leading to power disruption and serious damage to equipment. 
ELECTRUM 
has 
links 
to 
Sandworm 
as 
their 
development 
group, 
but 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
understanding of which team actually carried out the attack has evolved over time. Regardless of the speci.c threat actor, the behaviors demonstrated are what are important to understand.

Telebots 
is 
the 
group 
attributed 
to 
the 
NotPetya 
ransomware 
outbreak, 
which 
is 
the 
most 
destructive attack in history from a .nancial perspective, and is reported to be an evolution of the group or groups responsible for causing the Ukrainian blackouts described in the previous two sections. In 2018, the security .rm ESET identi.ed code linkages between NotPetya and CRASHOVERRIDE (which they refer to as the Industroyer attack). The NotPetya attack initially targeted industries in Ukraine after the threat actor was able to effect a supply-chain compromise of Ukrainian accounting software. The incorporation of the EternalBlue exploit for SMB in conjunction with the password dumping tool Mimikatz enabled NotPetya to cripple networks around the globe.

Also Sandworm Team Known As 


Energetic Bear 
This group is assessed as the creator of the Havex RAT, which is one of .ve known ICS tailored malware families. Energetic Bear campaigns began in 2010 in order to collect intelligence used for espionage (as opposed to attempting destruction or disruption of systems) and have continued through at least 2017. The TTPs leveraged by this threat actor are not unique or particularly novel, but the systematic and deliberate social engineering strategies employed are. Smaller, less defended companies and subcontractors within the energy sector have been targeted ¡ª likely as a 
means 
for 
the 
actor, 
in 
turn, 
to 
target 
regional 
and 
national-level 
energy 
companies 
and 
power 
suppliers.

Also Dragon.y, Crouching Yeti, Havex, Koala, Iron Liberty Known As 

DYMALLOY 
Some researchers attribute the activities of this group to an evolution of Energetic Bear activity (referring 
to 
earlier 
activity 
as 
Dragon.y 
and 
later 
activity 
as 
Dragon.y 
2.0); 
however, 
Dragos 
asserts 
that 
there 
are 
enough 
technical 
differences 
to 
justify 
tracking 
this 
as 
a 
separate 
group. 
This group avoids using custom malware, opting for commodity malware families that hinder attempts at applying attribution. Crowdstrike 
reports 
that 
this 
group 
has 
strong 
ties 
to 
Moscow, 
as 
targeting aligns closely with likely collection priorities of Russian intelligence.

This espionage-focused group has also operated since at least the mid 2000s, targeting multiple sectors 
around 
the 
world 
with 
special 
focus 
on 
defensive 
sector 
organizations. 
Multiple governments have attributed the actions of this group to Russian military intelligence service, and notable 
operations 
have 
targeted 
organizations 
such 
as 
the 
International 
Olympic 
Committee, 
the 
Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and the Democratic National Committee (similar to APT29). Cybersecurity researchers identify this actor as conducting some of the most far-reaching and sophisticated Russian cyber attack campaigns to date.

malware. 
Evidence 
suggests 
that 
the 
ransom 
demand 
varies 
depending 
on 
the 
size 
of 
the targeted organization, and, as of January 2019, the total amount collected by the group was $3.7 million USD. At the end of 2019, researchers identi.ed that WIZARD SPIDER continues to add functionality to the Ryuk variants it delivers in order to maximize the number of systems within a network impacted by .le encryption.

group 
to 
Moonlight 
Maze, 
a 
massive 
data 
breach 
of U.S. government classi.ed information in the late 1990s, and one of the .rst widely known cyber espionage campaigns in history. Another notable campaign took place in 2008, when Agent.btz malware infected U.S. government classi.ed networks via infected removable media. This group is still in active operation today. More 
recent 
operations 
of 
this 
Russian 
cyber 
attack 
campaign and group have been extremely targeted, going through extensive lengths to .ngerprint systems, collecting as much information as possible, before making a determination as to whether the target is of interest for further operations. One of the techniques utilized includes attempting to lure visitors of compromised websites to download fake Adobe Flash updates, an approach utilized by cyber criminals across the globe.

Also Snake, Venomous Bear, Waterbug, Uroburos Known As 

XENOTIME 
This group has been identi.ed as the most dangerous threat actor publicly known, due to its association with malware known as TRITON, designed to target a speci.c safety instrumented system 
(SIS) 
within 
industrial 
control 
systems. 
SIS are hardware and software controls used to implement safe states in order to avoid adverse safety, health, and environmental consequences, and, 
as 
such, 
targeting 
of 
these 
systems 
could 
lead 
to 
loss 
of 
life 
scenarios. 
TRITON 
was 
discovered 
at 
a 
petrochemical 
plant 
in 
Saudi 
Arabia 
when 
the 
attacker 
was 
believed 
to 
have 
inadvertently shut down plant operations after gaining access to a SIS engineering workstation to deploy the attack framework. Because TRITON malware samples are now easily discoverable online, the bar has effectively been lowered for other threat actors to enter the ICS arena.

Gamaredon Group 
This group notably conducts espionage and intelligence gathering via Russian cyber attack strategies in support of Russian national interests, and seems to primarily focus efforts on Ukrainian 
national 
security 
targets. 
Cybersecurity researchers have pointed out that this group¡¯s current activities potentially serve as a testbed for evaluating adversarial response to TTPs, with the implication that the group could pivot to utilizing these tactics against future perceived threats beyond Ukraine.

The 
operations 
of 
this

motivated 
threat 
group 
have 
continued 
well 
into 
2020, 
despite 
the U.S. Department 
of 
Justice 
announcing 
arrests 
in 
August 
2018 
of 
individuals 
with 
ties 
to 
the 
group. This group is known for leveraging Carbanak malware in addition to other tools, in order to enable the theft of more than 15 million customer credit card records from victims spanning hundreds of companies in the United States and abroad. FIN7 operators have engaged in sophisticated 
social 
engineering 
techniques, 
including 
actively 
engaging 
targets 
in 
back
