Anewly 
patched 
zeroday 
vulnerability 
in 
Internet 
Explorer 
(http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/remotecodeexecutionvulnerabilityinternetexplorerpatched) 
has 
already 
been 
exploited 
in 
attacks 
involving 
a 
compromised 
website 
belonging 
to 
an 
evangelical 
church 
in 
Hong 
Kong. 
Symantec 
telemetry 
revealed 
an 
exploit 
hosted 
on 
the 
compromised 
site, 
which 
was 
used 
to 
infect 
visitors 
with 
the 
Korplug 
back 
door 
(detected 
by 
Symantec 
as 
Backdoor.Korplug 
(http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012062914253199)). 


The 
attackers 
compromised 
the 
website 
of 
the 
Evangelical 
Lutheran 
Church 
of 
Hong 
Kong 
and 
modified 
it 
to 
host 
a 
malicious 
iFrame 
which 
redirected 
visitors 
to 
another 
website 
hosting 
an 
exploit 
of 
the 
Microsoft 
Internet 
Explorer 
Remote 
Memory 
Corruption 
Vulnerability 
(http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/76403) 
(CVE20152502). 
The 
IP 
address 
of 
this 
website 
is 
115.144.107.55. 


This 
website 
hosts 
a 
file 
called 
vvv.html, 
which 
redirects 
to 
one 
of 
two 
other 
files 
called 
a.js 
and 
b.js 
and 
leads 
to 
the 
download 
of 
a 
file 
called 
java.html 
to 
the 
victim’s 
computer. 
Java.html 
installs 
Korplug 
on 
the 
computer, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
executable 
called 
c.exe.

Malicious 
iFrame

Korplug 
(also 
known 
as 
PlugX) 
is 
a 
Trojan 
that 
maintains 
a 
back 
door 
on 
an 
infected 
computer 
and 
facilitates 
information 
stealing. 
Symantec 
has 
previously 
released 
several 
blogs 
(http://www.symantec.com/connect/nl/blogtags/
backdoorkorplug) 
around 
Korplug. 
The 
malware 
has 
been 
used 
in 
a 
range 
of 
attacks, 
mainly 
inAsia, 
over 
the 
past 
three 
years.

Zeroday 
exploit 
leads 
to 
Korplug 
infection 


The 
new 
Internet 
Explorer 
zeroday 
bug 
was 
patched 
yesterday 
by 
Microsoft 
as 
part 
of 
Security 
Bulletin 
MS15093 
(https://technet.microsoft.com/enus/
library/security/ms15093.
aspx). 
The 
vulnerability 
permits 
remote 
code 
execution 
if 
a 
user 
views 
a 
specially 
crafted 
web 
page 
using 
Internet 
Explorer. 
Successful 
exploitation 
of 
the 
vulnerability 
will 
grant 
the 
attacker 
the 
same 
user 
rights 
as 
the 
current 
user. 
Microsoft’s 
security 
update 
resolves 
this 
issue 
by 
modifying 
how 
Internet 
Explorer 
handles 
objects 
in 
memory. 


Protection 


Symantec 
and 
Norton 
products

the 
exploit 
of 
this 
vulnerability
