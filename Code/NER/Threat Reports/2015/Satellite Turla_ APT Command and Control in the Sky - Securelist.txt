Have 
you 
ever 
watched 
satellite 
television? 
Were 
you 
amazed 
by 
the 
diversity 
of 
TV 
channels 
and 
radio 
stations 
available? 
Have 
you 
ever 
looked 
in 
wonder 
at 
satellite 
phones 
or 
satellitebased 
Internet 
connections 
wondering 
what 
makes 
them 
tick? 
What 
if 
we 
told 
you 
that 
there’s 
more 
to 
satellitebased 
Internet 
connections 
than 
entertainment, 
traffic 
and 
weather? 
Much, 
much 
more.

Turla:HidingTracesHighint...
When 
you 
are 
an 
APT 
group, 
you 
need 
to 
deal 
with 
many 
different 
problems. 
One 
of 
them, 
and 
perhaps 
the 
biggest, 
is 
the 
constant 
seizure 
and 
takedown 
of 
domains 
and 
servers 
used 
for 
commandandcontrol 
(C&C). 
These 
servers 
are 
constantly 
appropriated 
by 
law 
enforcement 
or 
shut 
down 
by 
ISPs. 
Sometimes 
they 
can 
be 
used 
to 
trace 
the 
attackers 
back 
to 
their 
physical 
locations. 


Some 
of 
the 
most 
advanced 
threat 
actors 
or 
users 
of 
commercial 
hacking 
tools 
have 
found 
a 
solution 
to 
the 
takedown 
problem 
— 
the 
use 
of 
satellitebased 
Internet 
links. 
In 
the 
past, 
we’ve 
seen 
three 
different 
actors 
using 
such 
links 
to 
mask 
their 
operations. 
The 
most 
interesting 
and 
unusual 
of 
them 
is 
the 
Turla 
group. 


Also 
known 
as 
Snake 
or 
Uroburos, 
names 
which 
come 
from 
its 
top 
class 
rootkit, 
the 
Turla 
cyberespionage 
group 
has 
been 
active 
for 
more 
than 
8 
years. 
Several 
papers 
have 
been 
published 
about 
the 
group’s 
operations, 
but 
until 
the 
Epic 
Turla 
research 
was 
published 
by 
Kaspersky 
Lab, 
little 
information 
was 
available 
about 
the 
more 
unusual 
aspects 
of 
their 
operations, 
such 
as 
the 
first 
stages 
of 
infection 
through 
wateringhole 
attacks. 


What 
makes 
the 
Turla 
group 
special 
is 
not 
just 
the 
complexity 
of 
its 
tools, 
which 
include 
the 
Uroboros 
rootkit, 
aka 
“Snake”, 
as 
well 
as 
mechanisms 
designed 
to 
bypass 
air 
gaps 
through 
multistage 
proxy 
networks 
inside 
LANs, 
but 
the 
exquisite 
satellitebased 
C&C 
mechanism 
used 
in 



-

the 
latter 
stages 
of 
the 
attack. 


In 
this 
blog, 
we 
hope 
to 
shed 
more 
light 
on 
the 
satellitebased 
C&C 
mechanisms 
that 
APT 
groups, 
including 
the 
Turla/Snake 
group, 
use 
to 
control 
their 
most 
important 
victims. 
As 
the 
use 
of 
these 
mechanisms 
becomes 
more 
popular, 
it’s 
important 
for 
system 
administrators 
to 
deploy 
the 
correct 
defense 
strategies 
to 
mitigate 
such 
attacks. 
For 
IOCs, 
see 
the 
appendix. 



Technical 
details 


Although 
relatively 
rare, 
since 
2007 
several 
elite 
APT 
groups 
have 
been 
using 
— 
and 
abusing 
— 
satellite 
links 
to 
manage 
their 
operations 
— 
most 
often, 
their 
C&C 
infrastructure. 
Turla 
is 
one 
of 
them. 
Using 
this 
approach 
offers 
some 
advantages, 
such 
as 
making 
it 
hard 
to 
identify 
the 
operators 
behind 
the 
attack, 
but 
it 
also 
poses 
some 
risks 
to 
the 
attackers. 


On 
the 
one 
hand, 
it’s 
valuable 
because 
the 
true 
location 
and 
hardware 
of 
the 
C&C 
server 
cannot 
be 
easily 
determined 
or 
physically 
seized. 
Satellitebased 
Internet 
receivers 
can 
be 
located 
anywhere 
within 
the 
area 
covered 
by 
a 
satellite, 
and 
this 
is 
generally 
quite 
large. 
The 
method 
used 
by 
the 
Turla 
group 
to 
hijack 
the 
downstream 
links 
is 
highly 
anonymous 
and 
does 
not 
require 
a 
valid 
satellite 
Internet 
subscription. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
disadvantage 
comes 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
satellitebased 
Internet 
is 
slow 
and 
can 
be 
unstable. 



-

In 
the 
beginning, 
it 
was 
unclear 
to 
us 
and 
other 
researchers 
whether 
some 
of 
the 
links 
observed 
were 
commercial 
Internet 
connections 
via 
satellite, 
purchased 
by 
the 
attackers, 
or 
if 
the 
attackers 
had 
breached 
the 
ISPs 
and 
performed 
ManintheMiddle 
(MitM) 
attacks 
at 
the 
router 
level 
to 
hijack 
the 
stream. 
We 
have 
analyzed 
these 
mechanisms 
and 
come 
to 
the 
astonishing 
conclusion 
that 
the 
method 
used 
by 
the 
Turla 
group 
is 
incredibly 
simple 
and 
straightforward, 
as 
well 
as 
highly 
anonymous 
and 
very 
cheap 
to 
operate 
and 
manage. 


Real 
satellite 
links, 
MitM 
attacks 
or 
BGP 
hĳacking? 


Purchasing 
satellitebased 
Internet 
links 
is 
one 
of 
the 
options 
APT 
groups 
can 
choose 
to 
secure 
their 
C&C 
traffic. 
However, 
full 
duplex 
satellite 
links 
can 
be 
very 
expensive: 
a 
simple 
duplex 
1Mbit 
up/down 
satellite 
link 
may 
cost 
up 
to 
$7000 
per 
week. 
For 
longer 
term 
contracts 
this 
cost 
may 
decrease 
considerably, 
but 
the 
bandwidth 
still 
remains 
very 
expensive. 


Another 
way 
of 
getting 
a 
C&C 
server 
into 
a 
satellite’s 
IP 
range 
is 
to 
hijack 
the 
network 
traffic 
between 
the 
victim 
and 
the 
satellite 
operator 
and 
to 
inject 
packets 
along 
the 
way. 
This 
requires 
either 
exploitation 
of 
the 
satellite 
provider 
itself, 
or 
of 
another 
ISP 
on 
the 
way. 


These 
kinds 
of 
hijacking 
attacks 
have 
been 
observed 
in 
the 
past 
and 
were 
documented 
by 
Renesys 
(now 
part 
of 
Dyn) 
in 
a 
blogpost 
dated 
November 
2013. 


According 
to 
Renesys: 
“Various 
providers’ 
BGP 
routes 
were 
hijacked, 
and 
as 
a 
result 
a 
portion 
of 
their 
Internet 
traffic 
was 
misdirected 
to 
flow 
through 
Belarusian 
and 
Icelandic 
ISPs. 
We 
have 
BGP 
routing 
data 
that 
show 
the 
secondbysecond 
evolution 
of 
21 
Belarusian 
events 
in 
February 
and 
May 
2013, 
and 
17 
Icelandic 
events 
in 
JulyAugust 
2013.” 


In 
a 
more 
recent 
blogpost 
from 
2015, 
Dyn 
researchers 



-

point 
out 
that: 
“For 
security 
analysts 
reviewing 
alert 
logs, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
appreciate 
that 
the 
IP 
addresses 
identified 
as 
the 
source 
of 
incidents 
can 
and 
are 
regularly 
spoofed. 
For 
example, 
an 
attack 
that 
appeared 
to 
come 
from 
a 
Comcast 
IP 
located 
in 
New 
Jersey 
may 
really 
have 
been 
from 
a 
hijacker 
located 
in 
Eastern 
Europe, 
briefly 
commandeering 
Comcast 
IP 
space. 
It 
is 
interesting 
to 
note 
that 
all 
six 
cases 
discussed 
above 
were 
conducted 
from 
either 
Europe 
or 
Russia.” 


Obviously, 
such 
incredibly 
apparent 
and 
largescale 
attacks 
have 
little 
chance 
of 
surviving 
for 
long 
periods 
of 
time, 
which 
is 
one 
of 
the 
key 
requirements 
for 
running 
an 
APT 
operation. 
It 
is 
therefore 
not 
very 
feasible 
to 
perform 
the 
attack 
through 
MitM 
traffic 
hijacking, 
unless 
the 
attackers 
have 
direct 
control 
over 
some 
hightraffic 
network 
points, 
such 
as 
backbone 
routers 
or 
fiber 
optics. 
There 
are 
signs 
that 
such 
attacks 
are 
becoming 
more 
common, 
but 
there 
is 
a 
much 
simpler 
way 
to 
hijack 
satellitebased 
Internet 
traffic. 



Satellite 
link 
(DVB-S) 
hĳacking 


The 
hijacking 
of 
satellite 
DVBS 
links 
has 
been 
described 
a 
few 
times 
in 
the 
past 
and 
a 
presentation 
on 
hijacking 
satellite 
DVB 
links 
was 
delivered 
at 
BlackHat 
2010 
by 
the 



-

S21Sec 
researcher 
Leonardo 
Nve 
Egea. 


To 
hijack 
satellite 
DVBS 
links, 
one 
needs 
the 
following: 



A 
satellite 
dish 
– 
the 
size 
depends 
on 
geographical 
position 
and 
satellite 
A 
lownoise 
block 
downconverter 
(LNB) 
A 
dedicated 
DVBS 
tuner 
(PCIe 
card) 
A 
PC, 
preferably 
running 
Linux 
While 
the 
dish 
and 
the 
LNB 
are 
moreorless 
standard, 
the 
card 
is 
perhaps 
the 
most 
important 
component. 
Currently, 
the 
best 
DVBS 
cards 
are 
made 
by 
a 
company 
called 
TBS 
Technologies. 
The 
TBS6922SE 
is 
perhaps 
the 
best 
entrylevel 
card 
for 
the 
task. 



TBS6922SE 
PCIe 
card 
for 
receiving 
DVBS 
channels 


The 
TBS 
card 
is 
particularly 
wellsuited 
to 
this 
task 
because 
it 
has 
dedicated 
Linux 
kernel 
drivers 
and 
supports 
a 
function 
known 
as 
a 
bruteforce 
scan 
which 
allows 
widefrequency 
ranges 
to 
be 
tested 
for 
interesting 
signals. 
Of 
course, 
other 
PCI 
or 
PCIe 
cards 
might 
work 
as 
well, 
while, 
in 
general 
the 
USBbased 
cards 
are 
relatively 
poor 
and 
should 
be 
avoided. 


Unlike 
full 
duplex 
satellitebased 
Internet, 
the 
downstreamonly 
Internet 
links 
are 
used 
to 
accelerate 
Internet 
downloads 
and 
are 
very 
cheap 
and 
easy 
to 
deploy. 
They 
are 
also 
inherently 
insecure 
and 
use 
no 
encryption 
to 
obfuscate 
the 
traffic. 
This 
creates 
the 



-

possibility 
for 
abuse. 


Companies 
that 
provide 
downstreamonly 
Internet 
access 
use 
teleport 
points 
to 
beam 
the 
traffic 
up 
to 
the 
satellite. 
The 
satellite 
broadcasts 
the 
traffic 
to 
larger 
areas 
on 
the 
ground, 
in 
the 
Ku 
band 
(1218Ghz) 
by 
routing 
certain 
IP 
classes 
through 
the 
teleport 
points. 


How 
does 
satellite 
internet 
hĳacking 
work? 



To 
attack 
satellitebased 
Internet 
connections, 
both 
the 
legitimate 
users 
of 
these 
links 
as 
well 
as 
the 
attackers’ 
own 
satellite 
dishes 
point 
to 
the 
specific 
satellite 
that 
is 
broadcasting 
the 
traffic. 
The 
attackers 
abuse 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
packets 
are 
unencrypted. 
Once 
an 
IP 
address 
that 
is 
routed 
through 
the 
satellite’s 
downstream 
link 
is 
identified, 
the 
attackers 
start 
listening 
for 
packets 
coming 
from 
the 
Internet 
to 
this 
specific 
IP. 
When 
such 
a 
packet 
is 
identified, 
for 
instance 
a 
TCP/IP 
SYN 
packet, 
they 
identify 
the 
source 
and 
spoof 
a 
reply 
packet 
(e.g. 
SYN 
ACK) 
back 
to 
the 
source 
using 
a 
conventional 
Internet 
line. 


At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
legitimate 
user 
of 
the 
link 
just 
ignores 
the 
packet 
as 
it 
goes 
to 
an 
otherwise 
unopened 
port, 
for 
instance, 
port 
80 
or 
10080. 
There 
is 
an 
important 
observation 
to 
make 
here: 
normally, 
if 
a 
packet 
hits 
a 
closed 
port, 
a 
RST 
or 
FIN 
packet 
will 
be 
sent 
back 
to 
the 
source 
to 
indicate 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
expecting 
the 
packet. 
However, 
for 
slow 
links, 
firewalls 
are 
recommended 
and 
used 
to 
simply 
DROP 
packets 
to 



-

closed 
ports. 
This 
creates 
an 
opportunity 
for 
abuse. 


Abused 
Internet 
ranges 


During 
the 
analysis, 
we 
observed 
the 
Turla 
attackers 
abusing 
several 
satellite 
DVBS 
Internet 
providers, 
most 
of 
them 
offering 
downstreamonly 
connections 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
Africa. 
Interestingly, 
the 
coverage 
of 
these 
beams 
does 
not 
include 
Europe 
or 
Asia, 
meaning 
that 
a 
dish 
is 
required 
in 
either 
the 
Middle 
East 
or 
Africa. 
Alternatively, 
a 
much 
larger 
dish 
(3m+) 
can 
be 
used 
in 
other 
areas 
to 
boost 
the 
signal. 


To 
calculate 
the 
dish 
size, 
one 
can 
use 
various 
tools, 
including 
online 
resources 
such 
as 
satbeams.com:

One 
interesting 
case 
is 
probably 
84.11.79.6, 
which 
falls 
into 
the 
satellite 
IP 
range 
of 
IABG 
mbH. 


This 
IP 
is 
encrypted 
in 
the 
C&C 
of 
the 
following 
backdoor 
used 
by 
Turla 
group, 
known 
as 
“Agent.DNE“:

C&C 
configuration 


This 
Agent.DNE 
sample 
has 
a 
compilation 
timestamp 
of 
Thu 
Nov 
22 
14:34:15 
2007, 
meaning 
that 
the 
Turla 
group 
has 
been 
using 
satellitebased 
Internet 
links 
for 
almost 
eight 
years. 


Conclusions 


The 
regular 
usage 
of 
satellitebased 
Internet 
links 
by 
the 
Turla 
group 
represents 
an 
interesting 
aspect 
of 
their 
operation. 
The 
links 
are 
generally 
up 
for 
several 
months, 



-

but 
never 
for 
too 
long. 
It 
is 
unknown 
if 
this 
is 
due 
to 
operational 
security 
limitations 
selfimposed 
by 
the 
group 
or 
because 
of 
shutdown 
by 
other 
parties 
due 
to 
malicious 
behavior. 


The 
technical 
method 
used 
to 
implement 
these 
Internet 
circuits 
relies 
on 
hijacking 
downstream 
bandwidth 
from 
various 
ISPs 
and 
packetspoofing. 
This 
is 
a 
method 
that 
is 
technically 
easy 
to 
implement, 
and 
provides 
a 
much 
higher 
degree 
of 
anonymity 
than 
possibly 
any 
other 
conventional 
method 
such 
as 
renting 
a 
VPS 
or 
hacking 
a 
legitimate 
server. 


To 
implement 
this 
attack 
methodology, 
the 
initial 
investment 
is 
less 
than 
$1000. 
Regular 
maintenance 
should 
be 
less 
than 
$1000 
per 
year. 
Considering 
how 
easy 
and 
cheap 
this 
method 
is, 
it 
is 
surprising 
that 
we 
have 
not 
seen 
more 
APT 
groups 
using 
it. 
Even 
though 
this 
method 
provides 
an 
unmatched 
level 
of 
anonymfor 
logistical 
reasons 
it 
is 
more 
straightforward 
to 
rely 
on 
bulletproof 
hosting, 
multiple 
proxy 
levels 
or 
hacked 
websites. 
In 
truth, 
the 
Turla 
group 
has 
been 
known 
to 
use 
all 
of 
these 
techniques, 
making 
it 
a 
very 
versatile, 
dynamic 
and 
flexible 
cyberespionage 
operation. 


Lastly, 
it 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
Turla 
is 
not 
the 
only 
APT 
group 
that 
has 
used 
satellitebased 
Internet 
links. 
HackingTeam 
C&Cs 
were 
seen 
on 
satellite 
IPs 
before, 
as 
well 
as 
C&Cs 
from 
the 
Xumuxu 
group 
and, 
more 
recently 
the 
Rocket 
Kitten 
APT 
group. 


If 
this 
method 
becomes 
widespread 
between 
APT 
groups 
or 
worse, 
cybercriminal 
groups, 
this 
will 
pose 
a 
serious 
problem 
for 
the 
IT 
security 
and 
counterintelligence 
communities.

the 
Turla 
group’s 
use 
of 
satellitebased 
Internet

Many 
thanks 
for 
sharing 
these 
observations! 
I 
believe 
that 
part 
of 
your 
analysis 
is 
mixed 
up. 


> 
Once 
an 
IP 
address 
that 
is 
routed 
through 
the 
satellite’s 
downstream 
link 
is 
identified, 
the 
attackers 
start 
listening 
for 
packets 
coming 
from 
the 
Internet 
to 
this 
specific 
IP. 
When 
such 
a 
packet 
is 
identified, 
for 
instance 
a 
TCP/IP 
SYN 
packet, 
they 
identify 
the 
source 
and 
spoof 
a 
reply 
packet 
(e.g. 
SYN 
ACK) 
back 
to 
the 
source 
using 
a 
conventional 
Internet 
line. 


Say, 
Alice 
is 
the 
ordinary/legitimate 
subscriber, 
Bob 
sends 
this 
SYN 
packet 
to 
her, 
which 
is 
also 
received 
by 
Mallory, 
and 
Mallory 
sends 
the 
SYN/ACK. 
If 
Bob 
sends 
this 
SYN 
packet, 
he 
probably 
expects 
Alice 
to 
send 
the 
SYN/ACK, 
which 
she 
does. 
So, 
both 
Alice 
and 
Mallory 
send 
a 
SYN/ACK. 
What 
is 
Mallory 
supposed 
to 
gain 
from 
this? 


> 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
legitimate 
user 
of 
the 
link 
just 
ignores 
the 
packet 
as 
it 
goes 
to 
an 
otherwise 
unopened 
port, 
for 
instance, 
port 



-

80 
or 
10080. 


Huh? 
Bob 
opened 
that 
connection, 
so 
he 
certainly 
does 
not 
ignore 
packets. 
Alice 
responds 
to 
a 
SYN 
packet, 
so 
she 
does 
not 
ignore 
either. 
The 
port 
observed 
by 
Mallory 
quite 
likely 
is 
*not* 
unopened. 


Instead, 
if 
I 
were 
Mallory, 
I 
would 
do 
the 
following: 
I 
see 
that 
Alice 
is 
a 
satellite 
subscriber 
and 
learn 
her 
IP 
address. 
Thus, 
I 
can 
send 
TCP 
SYN 
to 
Port 
80 
on 
her 
IP 
address. 
If 
she 
does 
not 
run 
a 
web 
server 
and 
is 
behind 
a 
firewall, 
I 
won’t 
receive 
a 
reply. 
Thus, 
I 
can 
use 
her 
IP 
address 
and 
port 
80 
for 
my 
own 
server. 
(In 
fact, 
I 
can 
port 
scan 
on 
her; 
if 
she 
drops 
any 
SYN 
packet 
I 
can 
use 
that 
port 
instead 
of 
80.) 
Packets 
will 
be 
delivered 
to 
her 
and 
me, 
she 
(or 
her 
firewall) 
throws 
away 
the 
packets, 
so 
my 
own 
connection 
will 
be 
stable. 


I’d 
like 
to 
point 
out 
the 
lesson 
to 
be 
learned 
here: 
If 
you 
are 
on 
a 
broadcast 
network, 
send 
your 
RST 
packets. 
Otherwise, 
everyone 
is 
free 
to 
hide 
under 
your 
IP 
address. 


(Besides, 
if 
there 
are 
unassigned 
IP 
addresses, 
Mallory 
might 
just 
use 
one 
of 
those—if 
they 
are 
routed 
by 
the 
satellite 
network’s 
operator, 
although 
they 
are 
unassigned.)
