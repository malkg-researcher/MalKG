Introduction 


 


Increasingly
, 
c
yber
attacks 
targeting 
various 
industrial sectors are 
directed towards 
prominent 
institutions
. 
In a 
recent incident 
reported on 
April 8, 2015, 
TV5 
Monde, one of France’s largest global television 
networks was 
attacked 
by hackers
, 
resulting in the disruption of 
eleven 
TV5 Monde
’s ch
annels. According to TV5 
Monde
, 
a 
hacker group claiming 
to be linked 
to the Islamic State Group executed the attack
. 


 


This report 
analyze
s 
the 
malwares used in 
t
he 
targeted attack 
against 
TV5 Monde 
in France. 


 


 


Attack Outline 


At 
10 pm on April 8, 2015, 
TV5 
Monde fell victim to a cyberattack 
by 
Islamic 
fundamentalist 
hack
er 
group, 
“Cyber Caliphate”, 
which 
claims to be linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). 
Back in January 
2015, this group 
hacked into the official Twitter account of the 
United States Central Command
. 


In this incident, 
11 
programme broadcasts of 
TV5 Monde 
channels were 
disrupted for 3 hours as the hacker 
group breaches the Network’s internal systems 
and 
overri
ding 
the digital 
broadcast system
. T
he 
hacker 
group also took control of the N
etwork’s 
administrative systems making 
emails inaccessible
. The Network’s 
social media accounts and website were not spared. The Network’s 
Facebook account was 
hacked, 
and 
made to display images of ISIS
.

C
omplete details 
on the attack 
are still uncertain
, but the N
etwork’s 
soft 
approach to security 
was 
expose
d 
on live television
.

a

ed

p
ost

s
. 
One of the p
ost
-
it note
s 
revealed 
the 
network's passwords for YouTube
. 
Twitter user 
“
pent0thal
” 
confirmed that 
the 
password was "lemotdepassedeyoutube," which translates in English to "the password of 
YouT
ube."

Another password spotted 


 



The same user
, pent0thal, discovered another password in a publicly broadcasted segment of the news, 
which can be seen 
above. 
TV5Monde’s negligent 
approach to security
, 
like 
writing 
account information 
on 
notepads 
pasted 
on wa
lls, may have contributed to the 
hacking 
incident
. 


 


On April 9, 2015, Blue C

, a security vendor, released a press statement on the TV5Monde attack
.

According to this 
statemen
t, the malware us
ed in the 
TV5 Monde 
attack is a variant o
f 
Njworm 
that is popular 
in the Middle East.

Njrat and Njworm, based in the Middle East 


A Kuwaiti, known by the alias “njq8”, created Nj
RAT 
and Njworm
. 
A simple search o
n the web shows that 
t
here are 
numerous 
online 
video tutorials in the Arabic 
language 
sharing knowledge on executing and 
exploiting with njRAT and Njworm
. 
This level of 
knowledge sharing and support 
is making the backdoor 
malware 
popular among 
attackers in the 
Middle
-
East 
region
.

Many variants 
of this malware have been 
found ever since 
t
he source code was 
disclosed in May 2013
. 
A 
C# 
source code 
gen
erator was even uploaded on an Arabic developer’s site on December 8, 2014. 


With 
the 
increase 
in threats involving 
this malware, 
Microsoft Malware Protection Center 
(MMPC) 
took down 
the 
Nj
RAT 
and 
Njworm 
malware fam
ilies in 
June 2014. 
These 
malware 
families are believed to have been 
created by 
Kuwaiti, 
Naser Al Mutairi, aka nj
q
8, and 
Algerian, 
Mohamed Benabdellah, aka Houdini. 


T
h
ere 
is also VB 
source code 
generators
. The VBS 
codes are slightly different 
as compared to the C# 
source code 
generator, bu
t it performs the same action 
– 
stealing personal information and 
acting as a 
backdoor
. 
When the 
VB 
source code 
generator runs, the attacker must enter the port number, and specify 
the host address, name, directory and installation name. The 
output 
files c
reated could be slightly different.

Source code generator and generation process 


Let
’
s 
take a look at how some source code generators 
work.

Source Code

When you 
execute 
the generator, a 
window 
to set the port 
will appear. 
Then, a message 
stating the port is 
successfully connected will appear as below.

-
click on the white bar on the message above, a window will appear to send commands. The 
command 
type
s are divided into 
w0rm, Computer, Run 
and 
Options, 
and you can send various commands 
based on 
the command type
. 


 


[

After selecting a command, and clicking 
Builder
, a window to initialize the IP and port will appear. You can 
specify the host, port, name 
and install name, and select one of the six directories.

Let us take a 
look 
at another source code generator. When you open the generator, a 
window 
to enter the 
port number as 
in 
[

and 
a window to 
specify a few settings as in [
Figure

appear.

The options 
are only

[

The biggest 
difference between the two source code generators is 
the 
process to verify 
whether the 
environment 
is a virtual environment 
or 
physical 
environment
. 


Source Code Generator 1 does not include a 
function to verify the environment. 


On the other hand, Source Code Generator 2 offers 
vmcheck() 
function 
at the beg
inning of the 
exploit 
codes
, 
where if it is verified that the environment is verified as virtual
, 
the exploit code jumps to a process that 
immediately deletes the VBS file and terminates.

malware used in TV5Monde attack is a VBS (Vi

name, volume serial number and Windows version.

highly 
possible that it was created for testing. 


 


 


 


 


 



Conclu
sion 


A
hnLab has 
investigated 
the malware that s
eiz
ed control of France’s TV5Monde and disrupting the 
broadcast of 11 TV5Monde’s channels. 
Television networks 
are 
the perfect 
targets 
for cyber
-
attacks 
intended 
for 
political 
reasons and it 
has been proven 
possible for attac
kers to 
take control of the television broadcast
. 
Television 
broadcast companies ha
ve 
an immediate 
need to reinforce security and 
take targeted attacks 
seriously. 
Malware that are 
widely used 
in specific countr
ies 
or region
s 
could be 
executed as 
political attacks, 
so it is also important to be up
-
to
-
date about 
these malware
.
