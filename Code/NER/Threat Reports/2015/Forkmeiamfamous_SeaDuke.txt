Low-profile 
information-stealing 
Trojan 
is 
used 
only 
against 
high-
value 
targets. 



Symantec 
has 
uncovered 
an 
elusive 
Trojan 
used 
by 
the 
cyberespionage 
group 
behind 
the 
â€oeDukeâ€
family 
of 
malware. 
Seaduke 
(detected 
by 
Symantec 
as 
Trojan.Seaduke) 
is 
a 
low-profile 
information-
stealing 
Trojan 
which 
appears 
to 
be 
reserved 
for 
attacks 
against 
a 
small 
number 
of 
high-value 
targets. 


Seaduke 
has 
been 
used 
in 
attacks 
against 
a 
number 
of 
major, 
government-level 
targets. 
The 
malware 
hides 
behind 
numerous 
layers 
of 
encryption 
and 
obfuscation 
and 
is 
capable 
of 
quietly 
stealing 
andexfiltrating 
sensitive 
information 
such 
as 
email 
from 
the 
victimâ€™s 
computer. 
Seaduke 
has 
a 
highlyconfigurable 
framework 
and 
Symantec 
has 
already 
found 
hundreds 
of 
different 
configurations 
oncompromised 
networks. 
Its 
creators 
are 
likely 
to 
have 
spent 
a 
considerable 
amount 
of 
time 
and 
resourcesin 
preparing 
these 
attacks 
and 
the 
malware 
has 
been 
deployed 
against 
a 
number 
of 
high-level 
governmenttargets. 


While 
the 
Duke 
group 
began 
to 
distribute 
Cozyduke 
in 
an 
increasingly 
aggressive 
manner, 
Seadukeinstallations 
were 
reserved 
only 
for 
select 
targets. 
Seaduke 
victims 
are 
generally 
first 
infected 
withCozyduke 
and, 
if 
the 
computer 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
target 
of 
interest, 
the 
operators 
will 
install 
Seaduke. 


Background

The 
group 
behind 
Seaduke 
is 
a 
cyberespionage 
operation 
that 
is 
responsible 
for 
a 
series 
of 
attacks 
againsthigh-profile 
individuals 
and 
organizations 
in 
government, 
international 
policy 
and 
private 
research 
in 
theUnited 
States 
and 
Europe. 
It 
has 
a 
range 
of 
malware 
tools 
at 
its 
disposal, 
known 
as 
the 
Dukes, 
including 
Cozyduke 
(Trojan.Cozer), 
Miniduke 
(Backdoor.Miniduke) 
and 
Cosmicduke 
(Backdoor.Tinybaron). 



News 
of 
the 
Duke 
group 
first 
emerged 
in 
March 
and 
April 
of 
2015, 
when 
reports 
detailing 
attacksinvolving 
a 
sophisticated 
threat 
actor 
variously 
called 
Office 
Monkeys, 
EuroAPT, 
Cozy 
Bear, 
and 
Cozyduke 
were 
published. 
Symantec 
believes 
that 
this 
group 
has 
a 
history 
of 
compromisinggovernmental 
and 
diplomatic 
organizations 
since 
at 
least 
2010. 


The 
group 
began 
its 
current 
campaign 
as 
early 
as 
March 
2014, 
when 
Trojan.Cozer 
(aka 
Cozyduke) 
was 
identified 
on 
the 
network 
of 
a 
private 
research 
institute 
in 
Washington, 
D.C. 
In 
the 
months 
that 
followed, 
the 
Duke 
group 
began 
to 
target 
victims 
with 
â€oeOffice 
Monkeysâ€-and 
â€oeeFaxâ€-themed 
emails, 
booby-trapped 
with 
a 
Cozyduke 
payload. 
These 
tactics 
were 
atypical 
of 
a 
cyberespionage 
group. 
Itâ€™s 
quite 
likely 
these 
themes 
were 
deliberately 
chosen 
to 
act 
as 
a 
smokescreen, 
hiding 
the 
true 
intent 
of 
theadversary.

The 
Duke 
group 
has 
mounted 
an 
extended 
campaign 
targeting 
high-profile 
networks 
over 
extendedperiods, 
something 
which 
is 
far 
beyond 
the 
reach 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
threat 
actors. 
Its 
capabilities 
include: 



Attack 
infrastructure 
leveraging 
hundreds 
of 
compromised 
websites
Rapidly 
developed 
malware 
frameworks 
in 
concurrent 
use
Sophisticated 
operators 
with 
fine-tuned 
computer 
network 
exploitation 
(CNE) 
skills 
Although 
Cozyduke 
activity 
was 
first 
identified 
in 
March 
2014, 
it 
wasnâ€™t 
until 
July 
that 
the 
groupmanaged 
to 
successfully 
compromise 
high-profile 
government 
networks. 
Cozyduke 
was 
used 
throughoutthese 
attacks 
to 
harvest 
and 
exfiltrate 
sensitive 
information 
to 
the 
attackers. 


In 
parallel, 
the 
Duke 
group 
was 
also 
installing 
separate 
malware 
onto 
these 
networks, 
namelyBackdoor.Miniduke 
and 
the 
more 
elusive 
Trojan.Seaduke. 
It 
could 
use 
these 
payloads 
to 
exploit 
networkson 
multiple 
fronts 
and 
providing 
it 
with 
additional 
persistence 
mechanisms. 


The 
Miniduke 
payload

In 
July 
of 
2014, 
the 
group 
instructed 
Cozyduke-infected 
computers 
to 
install 
Backdoor.Miniduke 
onto 
a 
compromised 
network. 
Miniduke 
has 
been 
the 
groupâ€™s 
tool 
of 
choice 
for 
a 
number 
of 
years 
inespionage 
operations 
predominantly 
targeting 
government 
and 
diplomatic 
entities 
in 
Eastern 
Europe 
andex-Soviet 
states. 
â€oeNemesis 
Geminaâ€ 
appears 
to 
be 
the 
internal 
name 
for 
the 
framework 
used 
by 
thegroup 
to 
identify 
the 
project, 
previously 
reported 
by 
Kaspersky. 


The 
following 
debug 
string 
was 
present 
in 
the 
sample 
used 
in 
these 
attacks: 



C:\Projects\nemesis-gemina\nemesis\bin\carriers\ezlzma_x86_exe.pdb 


This 
project 
name 
has 
been 
seen 
in 
Backdoor.Tinybaron 
(aka 
Cosmicduke) 
samples, 
which 
Symantec 
also 
attributes 
to 
the 
Duke 
group. 
This 
deployment 
of 
Miniduke 
and 
the 
technical 
similarities 
withCozyduke 
provided 
strong 
indicators 
as 
to 
who 
was 
behind 
the 
attacks. 


The 
Seaduke 
payload

These 
attacks 
were 
already 
well 
underway 
when 
another 
group 
began 
to 
deploy 
a 
previously 
unknownpiece 
of 
malware. 
In 
October 
2014, 
the 
Seaduke 
payload 
began 
to 
appear 
within 
target 
networks.
Although 
Seaduke 
was 
developed 
in 
Python, 
the 
overall 
framework 
bears 
a 
striking 
resemblance 
toCozyduke 
in 
terms 
of 
operation. 
Itâ€™s 
unclear 
why 
the 
attackers 
waited 
until 
October 
to 
deploy 
Seaduke. 
Was 
it 
reserved 
for 
a 
more 
specific 
attack? 
Was 
part 
of 
their 
cover 
blown, 
necessitating 
the 
useof 
an 
alternative 
framework? 


The 
Seaduke 
framework 
was 
designed 
to 
be 
highly 
configurable. 
Hundreds 
of 
reconfigurations 
were 
identified 
on 
compromised 
networks. 
The 
communication 
protocol 
employed 
had 
many 
layers 
ofencryption 
and 
obfuscation, 
using 
over 
200 
compromised 
web 
servers 
for 
command 
and 
control. 
Seaduke 
required 
a 
significant 
investment 
of 
time 
and 
resources 
in 
the 
preparatory 
and 
operational 
phases 
of 
theattack. 


Seaduke 
delivery

The 
attackers 
control 
Cozyduke 
via 
compromised 
websites, 
issuing 
instructions 
to 
infected 
machines 
byuploading 
â€oetasksâ€ 
to 
a 
database 
file. 
Cozyduke 
will 
periodically 
contact 
these 
websites 
to 
retrievetask 
information 
to 
be 
executed 
on 
the 
local 
machine. 
One 
such 
task 
(an 
encoded 
PowerShell 
script)
instructed 
Cozyduke 
to 
download 
and 
execute 
Seaduke 
from 
a 
compromised 
website.

Seaduke 
operation

The 
attackers 
can 
operate 
Seaduke 
in 
a 
broadly 
similar 
fashion 
to 
Cozyduke. 
The 
Seaduke 
control 
infrastructure 
is 
essentially 
distinct, 
opening 
up 
the 
possibility 
of 
sub-teams 
concurrently 
exploiting 
the 



target 
network. 
Unlike 
Cozyduke, 
Seaduke 
operators 
upload 
â€oetaskâ€ 
files 
directly 
to 
the 
commandand-
control 
(C&C) 
server; 
there 
is 
no 
database 
as 
such 
present. 
Seaduke 
securely 
communicates 
with 
theC&C 
server 
over 
HTTP/HTTPS 
beneath 
layers 
of 
encoding 
(Base64) 
and 
encryption 
(RC4, 
AES). 
To 
an 
untrained 
eye, 
the 
communications 
look 
fairly 
benign, 
no 
doubt 
an 
effort 
to 
stay 
under 
the 
radar 
oncompromised 
networks. 




Figure 
3. 
How 
Seaduke 
operates 
on 
the 
target 
network 


Seaduke 
has 
many 
inbuilt 
commands 
which 
are 
available 
to 
the 
attackers. 
They 
have 
the 
ability 
toretrieve 
detailed 
bot/system 
information, 
update 
bot 
configuration, 
upload 
files, 
download 
files, 
and 
self-
delete 
the 
malware 
from 
the 
system. 
The 
self-delete 
function 
is 
interestingly 
called 
â€oeseppukuâ€. 
This 
is 
a 
form 
of 
Japanese 
ritual 
suicide. 


Seaduke 
payloads

The 
attackers 
have 
also 
developed 
a 
number 
of 
additional 
payloads. 
Operators 
can 
push 
these 
payloads 
onto 
infected 
machines 
for 
very 
specific 
attacks.

What 
next? 


The 
Duke 
group 
has 
brought 
its 
operational 
capability 
to 
the 
next 
level. 
Its 
attacks 
have 
been 
so 
bold 
and 
aggressive, 
that 
a 
huge 
amount 
of 
attention 
has 
been 
drawn 
to 
it, 
yet 
it 
appears 
to 
be 
unperturbed. 
Its 
success 
at 
compromising 
such 
high-profile 
targets 
has 
no 
doubt 
added 
a 
few 
feathers 
to 
its 
cap. 
Even 
the 
developers 
reveled 
in 
this 
fact, 
naming 
one 
of 
Seadukeâ€™s 
functions 
â€oeforkmeiamfamousâ€. 


While 
the 
group 
is 
currently 
keeping 
a 
lower 
profile, 
thereâ€™s 
no 
doubt 
it 
will 
reappear. 
Some 
tools 
may 
have 
to 
be 
abandoned, 
some 
reworked 
and 
others 
built 
completely 
from 
scratch. 
This 
attack 
group 
is 
in 
it 
for 
the 
long 
haul.
