November

By 
the 
end 
of 
2013, 
the 
Chinese 
cybercrime 
underground 
was 
a 
very 
busy 
economy, 
with 
peddled 
wares 
that 
not 
only 
targeted 
PCs, 
but 
mobile 
devices 
as 
well—making 
it 
its 
most 
prolific 
segment. 
We 
also 
saw 
cybercriminals 
abusing 
popular 
Web 
services 
such 
as 
the 
instantmessaging 
app 
(IM), 
QQ, 
to 
communicate 
with 
peers. 


Today, 
the 
Chinese 
underground 
is 
thriving 
more 
than 
ever. 
Previous 
explorations 
in 
the 
Chinese 
underground 
have 
indicated 
that 
cybercriminals 
are 
quick 
to 
adapt 
to 
technological 
advancements 
and 
existing 
trends 
as 
seen 
throughout 
2015. 
Data 
(either 
leaked 
or 
stolen) 
are 
now 
being 
traded 
along 
with 
prototypes 
and 
new 
functional 
hardware, 
like 
pointofsales 
(PoS) 
and 
automated 
teller 
machine 
(ATM) 
skimmers. 
As 
the 
Chinese 
underground 
continues 
to 
burgeon, 
we 
expect 
to 
see 
more 
cybercriminal 
activity 
using 
these 
new 
market 
offerings: 


Leaked 
data 
search 
engines 
and 
other 
offerings

Data 
leaked 
in 
the 
underground 
allows 
cybercriminals 
to 
commit 
various 
crimes 
like 
financial 
fraud, 
identity 
and 
intellectual 
property 
theft, 
espionage, 
and 
extortion. 
Chinese 
cybercriminals 
have 
managed 
to 
enhance 
the 
way 
they 
share 
data 
as 
seen 
in 
the 
case 
of 
SheYun, 
a 
search 
engine 
created 
specifically 
to 
make 
leaked 
data 
to 
users 
available. 


Over 
the 
last 
few 
years, 
we 
have 
been 
keeping 
track 
of 
the 
shift 
of 
prices 
of 
goods 
and 
services 
traded 
in 
the 
Chinese 
underground. 
Previously, 
we 
saw 
compromised 
hosts, 
DDoS 
attack 
tools 
services, 
and 
remote 
access 
Trojans 
(RATs) 
being 
sold. 
Today, 
social 
engineering 
tools 
have 
been 
added 
to 
the 
market.

past, 
as 
evidenced 
by 
the 
adoption 
of 
electronic 
and 
mobile 
payment 
means. 


Tampered 
PoS 
devices 
are

Some 
PoS 
skimmers 
come 
with 
an

that 
allows 
the

the 
stolen

remotely 
every

the

used.
