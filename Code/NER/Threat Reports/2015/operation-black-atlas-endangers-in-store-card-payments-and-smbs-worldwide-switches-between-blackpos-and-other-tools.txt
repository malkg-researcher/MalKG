With 
the 
coming 
holidays 
also 
come 
news 
of 
various 
credit 
card 
breaches 
that 
endanger 
the 
data 
of 
many 
industries 
and 
their 
customers. 
High-profile 
breaches, 
such 
as 
that 
of 
the 
Hilton 
Hotel 
and 
other 
similar 
establishments, 
were 
accomplished 
using 
point-of-sale 
(PoS) 
malware, 
leading 
many 
to 
fear 
digital 
threats 
on 
brick-and-mortar 
retailers 
this 
Thanksgiving, 
Black 
Friday, 
Cyber 
Monday, 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
holiday 
season. 
Researchers 
also 
found 
a 
broad 
campaign 
that 
uses 
the 
modular 
ModPOS 
malware 
to 
steal 
payment 
card 
data 
from 
retailers 
in 
the 
US. 


However, 
from 
what 
we 
have 
seen, 
it 
is 
not 
only 
retailers 
in 
the 
US 
that 
are 
at 
risk 
of 
breaches. 
Our 
researchers 
recently 
found 
an 
early 
version 
of 
a 
potentially 
powerful, 
adaptable, 
and 
invisible 
botnet 
that 
seeks 
out 
PoS 
systems 
within 
networks. 
It 
has 
already 
extended 
its 
reach 
to 
small 
and 
medium 
sized 
business 
networks 
all 
over 
the 
world, 
including 
a 
healthcare 
organization 
in 
the 
US. 
We 
are 
calling 
this 
operation 
BlackAtlas, 
in 
reference 
to 
BlackPOS, 
the 
malware 
primarily 
used 
in 
this 
operation. 


Operation 
BlackAtlas 
has 
been 
around 
since 
September 
2015, 
just 
in 
time 
to 
plant 
its 
seeds 
before 
the 
holiday 
season. 
Its 
targets 
include 
businesses 
in 
the 
healthcare, 
retail, 
and 
more 
industries 
which 
rely 
on 
card 
payment 
systems. 


The 
operation 
is 
run 
by 
technically 
sophisticated 
cybercriminals 
who 
are 
knowledgeable 
in 
a 
variety 
of 
penetration 
testing 
tools 
and 
possess 
a 
wide 
network 
of 
connections 
to 
PoS 
malware 
in 
the 
underground 
market. 
Its 
operators 
built 
a 
set 
of 
tools 
much 
like 
a 
Swiss 
army 
knife, 
with 
each 
tool 
offering 
a 
different 
functionality. 
Malware 
utilized 
in 
BlackAtlas 
included 
(but 
were 
not 
limited 
to) 
variants 
of 
Alina, 
NewPOSThings, 
a 
Kronos 
backdoor, 
and 
BlackPOS. 
BlackPOS, 
also 
known 
as 


Kaptoxa, 
was 
the 
malware 
used 
during 
the 
Target 
breach 
in 
2013 
and 
attacks 
on 
retail 
accounts 
in 
2014. 


Similar 
to 
GamaPoS, 
the 
BlackAtlas 
operators 
employed 
a 
“shotgun” 
approach 
to 
infiltrate 
networks 
as 
opposed 
to 
zeroing 
in 
on 
specific 
targets. 
They 
basically 
checked 
available 
ports 
on 
the 
Internet 
to 
see 
if 
they 
can 
get 
in, 
ending 
up 
with 
multiple 
targets 
around 
the 
world. 
The 
following 
graph 
shows 
where 
these 
targets 
are 
located:

So 
far, 
the 
BlackAtlas 
operators 
have 
been 
able 
to 
steal 
user 
credentials 
to 
websites 
that 
contain 
sensitive 
information, 
email 
accounts, 
and 
Facebook. 
The 
most 
interesting 
data 
we 
found 
was 
that 
of 
a 
live 
video 
feed 
of 
closed-circuit 
television 
(CCTV) 
cameras 
in 
a 
gasoline 
station. 
Either 
this 
is 
taking 
reconnaissance 
to 
another 
real-time 
level 
or 
the 
cybercriminals 
simply 
captured 
whatever 
information 
is 
available. 


How 
Operation 
BlackAtlas 
Works 


Our 
analysis 
of 
the 
attacks 
against 
these 
targets 
gave 
us 
further 
insights 
on 
how 
the 
BlackAtlas 
operators 
seek 
out 
PoS 
systems 
from 
networks. 
In 
one 
particular 
case, 
which 
involved 
a 
healthcare 
organization 
in 
the 
US, 
we 
found 
out 
how 
the 
BlackAtlas 
operators 
operate. 


Similar 
to 
a 
targeted 
attack, 
BlackAtlas 
involves 
an 
intelligence 
gathering 
or 
reconnaissance 
period 
where 
cybercriminals 
use 
a 
set 
of 
tools 
similar 
to 
a 
Swiss 
army 
knife 
to 
check 
how 
best 
to 
infiltrate 
systems. 
It 
also 
involves 
the 
use 
of 
tools 
such 
as 
brute 
force 
or 
dictionary 
attack 
tools, 
SMTP 
scanners, 
and 
remote 
desktop 
viewers. 
Networks 
with 
weak 
password 
practices 
are 
likely 
to 
fall 
victim 
to 
this 
initial 
penetration 
testing 
stage. 
Many 
of 
these 
tools 
are 
easily 
downloaded 
from 
various 
sites 
on 
the 
Internet.

Operation

Atlas 
infection 
chain 


The 
cybercriminals 
will 
then 
create 
a 
test 
plan 
based 
on 
the 
initial 
probe, 
and 
then 
use 
a 
second 
set 
of 
tools 
to 
execute 
the 
said 
plan. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
healthcare 
organization, 
the 
BlackAtlas 
operators 
utilized 
remote 
access 
tools 
to 
steal 
more 
information 
and 
move 
laterally 
within 
the 
network. 
The 
use 
of 
remote 
access 
tools 
at 
this 
stage 
depends 
on 
how 
the 
target 
environment 
is 
configured, 
with 
the 
method 
of 
gaining 
remote 
access 
also 
varying 
based 
on 
the 
target. 


Once 
inside, 
cybercriminals 
then 
familiarize 
themselves 
with 
the 
environment. 
What 
follows 
is 
the 
introduction 
of 
PoS 
threats, 
which 
the 
cybercriminals 
source 
from 
the 
operation’s 
broad 
Swiss 
army 
knife 
toolbox.The 
favored 
way 
to 
introduce 
other 
tools 
and 
threats 
is 
via 
the 
built-in 
command-line 
FTP 
since 
antimalware 
solutions 
had 
already 
blocked 
the 
initial 
site 
we 
had 
reported 
last 
September 
that 
hosted 
Katrina 
and 
CenterPoS. 


BlackAtlas 
operators 
used 
the 
modular 
botnet 
Gorynych 
or 
Diamond 
Fox 
in 
some 
installations. 
Gorynich 
was 
used 
to 
download 
a 
repurposed 
BlackPOS 
malware 
with 
RAM 
scraping 
functionality 
and 
upload 
all 
the 
dumped 
credit 
card 
numbers 
in 
memory. 
As 
the 
original 
BlackPOS 
used 
a 
text 
file 
to 
store 
pilfered 
credit 
card 
data, 
Gorynych 
now 
grabs 
that 
text 
file 
and 
does 
an 
HTTP 
POST 
to 
complete 
the 
data 
exfiltration:

In 
our 
next 
blog 
entry, 
we 
will 
discuss 
the 
steps 
of 
our 
investigation, 
how 
cybercriminals 
retrofitted 
the 
new 
Gorynych 
backdoor 
to 
use 
BlackPOS, 
and 
how 
the 
whole 
operation 
puts 
a 
variety 
of 
old 
and 
new 
PoS 
malware 
at 
the 
cybercriminals’ 
fingertips 
to 
easily 
gather 
financial 
information. 
We 
will 
also 
provide 
technical 
details, 
best 
practices, 
and 
recommendations 
to 
help 
IT 
managers 
and 
business 
owners 
evade 
or 
resolve 
this 
PoS 
threat.
