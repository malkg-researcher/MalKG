What we discuss today 


• 
Today I would introduce a case I am still working on. 
• 
The case is related to Military Sector, and it has been recorded with minimal 
differences in several EU military environments. 
• 
The details of the attack are under strict NDA, but with slight modifications I have 
the chance to share the most important details about the attacker strategies, tactics 
and tools used.

The adversary 


APT28 


• 
The attack has been attributed toAPT Group 28, also known as “Sofacy” or 
“Sednit”. I will call it “APT28” from now on. 
• 
APT28 group believed to have been in operation since 2007 and has been 
identified in several attacks that have targeted Eastern European governments, 
military and security-related organizations including the NorthAtlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO)
. 
The group uses a complex set of tools and strategies to put a foothold in an 
environment and to control and steal interesting data.

The target: the moat without water 


How to develop a good network segmentation and be breached 


• 
The attack 
has 
targeted 
a military 
environment 
in EMEAregion. 
• 
The environment has born segmented, 
with several layer of controls to preserve 
confidentiality and integrity of exchanged and stored data. 
• 
The segmentation separates the network in several layers with different level of 
“trust”
. 
• 
Any operator receives a badge and a smartcard to operate in the network. 
• 
Communication from a lower to an higher layer of trust is blocked, instead 
communication from higher layer to a lower one are permitted. 
• 
At the beginning of the investigation I discovered that the base lacks any real 
network visibility. 
The only network devices capable of analyzing streams were 
sporadic IDS and IPS placed in non strategic points. 

#RSAC

The target: the moat without water 


How to develop a good network segmentation and be breached 


• 
The environment is a Microsoft AD Forest with a pyramidal structure. 
• 
The root AD trusts several subdomains each with 
its proper set of AD servers. 
• 
The forest is regulated with different level of trust. 
• 
The «Secret» and «NATO» networks are physically 
separated entities were people can access only 
through dedicated machines. 
• 
Under no circumstances a user from standard AD 
structure can access Secret networks.

• 
Patching policies are 15 days behind Microsoft releases. 
• 
All other applications are patched and upgraded based on internal CERT 
approval. 
• 
The reason for the delay is due to the need to verify the consistency and the impact 
of upgrade/patch against production environment. 
• 
During the investigation we have discovered that, in the Data Center, two AD 
they have been breached. 


servers related to trusted subdomains, were not properly patched since November 
2014 due to the swap from a maintenance contractor to another.

The attack strategy 


How they 
break-in 


• 
The attack started from a targeted spear-phish campaign against the participants of 
the 2014 Farnborough Air Show. 
• 
The attack has targeted 7 officials of Air Force (AM) and 2 official of the Navy (MM) 
the email domain source was: “militaryexponews[.]com” 
• 
The attack exploit a Microsoft Word vulnerability (CVE-2015-2424)
. 
• 
Only in two cases the attack completes successfully for the attacker. 
• 
In seven cases, the exploit, despite successfully detonated, was not able to start the 
infection because the machines lack direct Internet access (proxy blocked 
connection attempts)
. 
• 
The reconstruction of the first stage has been performed after the creation of a 
proper set of IOCs starting from the infected systems.

The attack strategy 


More patients to care about… 


• 
To escalate the infection the attacker have used the OWAaccess of the stolen 
accounts to enumerate other potential victims for a new wave of targeted emails. 
• 
Also, one of the officers has access to internal Sharepoint 
service and participates 
to boards were specific internal meetings and projects are discussed. 
• 
With tailored messages published in Sharepoint 
board, the attacker has been able 
to sneak through the inner layers of the military infrastructure distributing the 
dropper.
One lesson I learn from Sharepoint… 
it has a horrible Log format.

The attack strategy 


The infection evolution 


• 
In this second wave of attack the adversary, knowing that the previous phase has 
not succeeded as planned due to access restriction with proxy and firewalls, has 
modified the dropper in order to work with internal proxy (with HTTP and SSL)
• 
The modification has insured the control of all successfully infected hosts.

The infection progression 


• 
The attacker has now a significant set of standard Domain Users account. 
• 
Not enough to pawn the infrastructure, but good enough as a starting point. 
• 
Thanks to his backdoor, he can easily begin to extend his action to other systems. 
• 
Lacking logs and network visibility, 
for that part, we can only speculate that he 
successfully identifies the vulnerable Navy subdomains by accessing Navy computers 
in the base. 
“interesting data” resides. 


The victims have direct access to the abovementioned AD servers because they use 
them for standard authentication.
APT28 at this point has breached AD servers, has collected domain admins 
credentials and has moved forward to the Root AD and the repositories where

How the victim discovers the problem 


• 
The diplomatic representation in Addis Ababa is composed of few militaries and 
several diplomats connected 
to Internet with the standard VPN service from public 
networks (transit 
through 
the Base). For that 
part, nobody has noticed the strange 
connections to the external C2s repeated each day. 
• 
But for a specific task, the owner of the infected laptop has used a connection from 
a military outpost, tightly regulated in access time and permissions. 
• 
Once connected, the computer has attempted to 
beacon to the C2s and the local 
network operator has identified the strange traffic signaling it to his superiors.

Patient Zero consequences 


How the attacker reacted 


• 
The Army has triaged the compromised system reinstalling the OS and applications 
and has close the case. 
• 
As 
result 
of the triage, the attacker changes 
strategy 
for a while. 
• 
APT28 has 
lowered 
the volume of his 
traffic 
and, for more than 
20 days 
nothing 
has 
been 
reported. 
• 
The military 
was 
ready closed

has 
been 
founded

#RSAC

What we can bring to the table? 


• 
I am 
part of RSA IR Team and our 
structured 
approach, developed 
from our 
field 
experience 
is 
now 
tuned 
to face attacks 
like 
this 
one. 
• 
Our approach leverages on “Actionable IoCs” and the support of tools that 
could easily integrate these IoCs to speedup the IR investigation process. 
• 
This is a methodology and not a “method”, because it counts on procedures, 
analyses and evidences in a scientifically sounding approach. 
• 


• 


To collect actionable IoCs we use a synergic approach that includes network 
and system visibility with log and malware analyses.
It involves aggregation of IoCs and their classification to create a “Knowledge 
Base” of attacks, tools and strategiesthat could be “reused” in subsequent 
engagements to streamline the response and support the attribution.

APT 28 Tools seen 
in this

• 
CORESHELL: This downloader is the evolution of the previous downloader of 
choice from APT28 known as “SOURFACE” (or “Sofacy”). This downloader, once 
executed, create the conditions to download and execute a second-stage 
(usually Eviltoss) from a C2. 
• 
EVILTOSS: This backdoor is delivered through CORESHELLdownloader to gain 
system access for reconnaissance, monitoring, credential theft, and shellcodeexecution. 
• 
CHOPSTICK: This is a modular implant compiled from a software framework that 
provides tailored functionality and flexibility. 
By far Chopstick is the most 
advanced tool used by APT 28. 
• 
MIMIKATZ: Everyone of us knows this tool. In this case, this has been of 
devastating effects to completely compromise AD Forest.

CHOPSTICK 


• 
CHOPSTICK is a Trojan family, written in C++ and built from a framework. 
• 
It offers a diverse set of capabilities for different deployments. 
• 
It collects detailed information from the host settings and it is aware of the presence 
of several security products. 
• 
It may communicate with external servers using SMTP, HTTP or HTTPs. 
• 
CHOPSTICK stores all collected information in a hidden file for temporary storage. 
• 
It communicates with the C2 via Windows “mailslot”, not named pipes or sockets. 
• 
CHOPSTICK main executable creates a “mailslot” in Windows machines and acts as 
the mailslot 
server, while its code injected into the other processes acts as a client 
allowing the Trojan to access and steal any type of information. 
• 
The RC4 encryption used here also uses a 50 bytes static key plus four-byte random 
salt value.

CHOPSTICK IOCs 


• 
Looking at network traffic we discover that, after approximately 60 seconds of 
execution time, CHOPSTICK begins communicating with one of its C2 servers. 
Usually as in our sample the traffic was over HTTP: 
GET /find/?itwm=90QDFR9CWZckwkTPHr2GOUXPXI91A&from=yVVgOqV1UG&utm=HTXh&utm=9kV7L3Z&oprnd=Xjp1kKrDgAeFu&from=06&9u2J=nYruvlhMtXN5HTTP/1.1

After sending an initial HTTP GET request it uploads the file contents of 
edg6EF885E2.tmp to the C2 server using HTTP POSTrequests.

Conclusion 


What 
I can suggest 


• 
It is extremely valuable to build an internal Knowledge base about incidents and 
attacks recorded and published and to extract IOCs from these incidents. 
• 
It is 
extremely 
useful 
to refocus 
the IR procedures 
dividing 
them 
in four

It could 
be extremely 
important 
to streamline 
the IR procedures 
by transforming 
IOCs 
to actionable 
IOCs, that 
means 
to evaluate 
and define 
which 
IOC can be reused 
and 
which 
one 
is 
limited 
to a specific 
attack 
or event. 
• 
It is 
important 
to drill 
and to give 
IR personnel 
the chance to learn 
how 
to build, use, 
extract, evaluate 
and properly 
storeActionable IOCs.
