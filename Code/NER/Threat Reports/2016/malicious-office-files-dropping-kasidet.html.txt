Introduction 


We 
have 
covered 
Dridex 
Banking 
Trojan 
being 
delivered 
via 
various 
campaigns 
involving 
Office 
SEARCH 
documents 
with 
malicious 
VBAmacros 
in 
the 
past. 
However, 
over 
the 
past 
two 
weeks 
we 
are 
seeing 
these 
malicious 
VBAmacros 
leveraged 
to 
drop 
Kasidet 
backdoor 
in 
addition 
to 
Dridex 
on 
the 
infected 
systems. 
These 
malicious 
Office 
documents 
are 
being 
spread 
as 
an 
attachment 
using 
spear 
phishing 
emails 
as 
described 
here. 
The 
malicious 
macro 
inside 
the 
Office 
document 
is 
obfuscated 
as 
shown 
in

In 
this 
blog, 
we 
will 
provide 
a 
detailed 
analysis 
for 
the 
Kasidet 
variant 
that 
we 
spotted 
in 
this 
campaign.

Kasidet 
installs 
itself 
into 
%APPDATA% 
folder. 
It 
creates 
a 
new

there 
with 
the 
name 
"Y1FeZFVYXllb", 
this 
string 
is 
hardcoded

The

is 
used 
as 
mutex

Information 
Stealing 
capabilities: 


Kasidet 
uses 
following 
two 
methods 
for 
stealing 
information 
from 
the 
victim's 
machine: 


1. 
Memory 
Scraping 
– 
This 
allows 
Kasidet 
to 
steal 
credit 
card 
data 
from 
the 
memory 
of 
Point-Of-Sale 
(POS) 
systems. 
It 
scans 
the 
memory 
of 
all 
the 
running 
processes 
except 
the 
operating 
system 
processes 
listed 
below: 
System 
smss.exe 
csrss.exe 
winlogon.exe 
lsass.exe 
spoolsv.exe 
devenv.exe 
The 
stolen 
information 
is 
relayed 
back 
to 
the 
attacker 
using 
following 
URI 
format 
– 


d=1&id=<MachineID>&name=<SystemName>&type=<Track1 
or 
Track2 
data>&data=<stolen 
data>&p= 
< 
Process 
elevation 
status 
> 


2. 
Browser 
Hooking 
– 
This 
allows 
Kasidet 
to 
steal 
data 
from 
Web 
browsers. 
It 
can 
inject 
code 
into 
FireFox, 
Chrome, 
and 
Internet 
Explorer 
(IE). 
Browser 
names 
are 
not 
saved 
in 
plain 
text 
and 
instead 
this 
variant 
uses 
the 
same 
hash 
function 
as 
used 
by 
Carberp 
malware 
to 
encrypt 
the 
browser 
names. 
The 
followingAPIs 
are 
hooked 
in 
the 
web 
browser 
for 
stealing 
sensitive 
data: 
Browser 
API 
FireFox 
PR_Write 
Chrome 
WSASend 
IE 
H􀀲pSendRequestW 
, 
InternetWriteFile� 


The 
stolen 
information 
is 
relayed 
back 
to 
the 
attacker 
using 
following 
URI 
format 
– 


ff=1&id=<MachineID>&name=<SystemName>&host=<Base64 
encoded 
host 
name>&form=< 
Base64 
encoded 
HTTP 
header 
data>&browser=<Browser 
name> 


The 
information 
stealing 
feature 
of 
this 
Kasidet 
variant 
were 
deactivated 
if 
the 
system 
locale 
or 
GeoUserID 
corresponds 
to 
Russia. 


Network 
communication: 


Kasidet 
contains 
a 
hardcoded 
list 
of 
Command 
& 
Control 
(C&C) 
server 
locations. 
It 
uses 
CryptStringToBinaryAPI 
call 
to 
decrypt 
the 
embedded 
C&C 
URLs

Conclusion 


Malicious 
Office 
document 
file 
is 
a 
popular 
vector 
for 
malware 
authors 
to 
deliver 
their 
payloads. 
Dridex 
authors 
have 
leveraged 
this 
technique 
for 
over 
a 
year 
and 
it 
was 
interesting 
to 
see 
the 
same 
campaign 
and 
URLs 
being 
leveraged 
to 
deliver 
Kasidet 
payloads. 
While 
this 
does 
not 
establish 
any 
links 
between 
the 
two 
malware 
family 
authors, 
it 
reaffirms 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
lot 
of 
the 
underlying 
infrastructure 
and 
delivery 
mechanisms 
are 
often 
shared 
by 
these 
cyber 
criminals. 


ThreatLabZ 
is 
actively 
monitoring 
this 
threat 
and 
ensuring 
signature 
coverage 
for 
Zscaler 
customers.
