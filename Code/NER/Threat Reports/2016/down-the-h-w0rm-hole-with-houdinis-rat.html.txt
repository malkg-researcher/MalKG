Commodity 
Remote 
Access 
Trojans 
(RATs) 
--which 
are 
designed, 
productized 
and 
sold 
to 
the 
casual 
and 
experienced 
hacker 
alike 
--put 
powerful 
remote 
access 
capabilities 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
criminals. 
RATs, 
such 
as 
H-W0rm, 
njRAT, 
KilerRAT, 
DarkComet, 
Netwire, 
XtremeRAT, 


JSocket/AlienSpy/Adwind 
and 
others, 
hold 
special 
interest 
for 
the 
Threat 
Research 
Team 
at 
Fidelis 
Cybersecurity. 
We're 
constantly 
following, 
detecting 
and 
monitoring 
the 
lifecycle 
of 
these 
RATs 
as 
they 
appear, 
disappear 
and 
often 
reappear 
under 
a 
new 
moniker. 


There 
have 
been 
recent 
reports 
1, 
2 
about 
a 
new 
version 
of 
one 
such 
commodity 
RAT, 
H-W0rm 
(Hworm), 
and 
the 
various 
campaigns 
it 
is 
being 
used 
in. 
Our 
telemetry 
shows 
that 
H-W0rm 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
active 
RATs 
we've 
seen, 
with 
infections 
observed 
across 
virtually 
all 
enterprise 
verticals 
and 
geographies 
in 
which 
Fidelis 
Cybersecurity 
products 
are 
deployed. 


In 
this 
blog 
post, 
the 
Threat 
Research 
Team 
at 
Fidelis 
Cybersecurity 
is 
supplementing 
these 
recent 
reports 
by 
providing 
the 
security 
community 
with 
the 
following: 



Technical 
descriptions 
of 
the 
payload 
behavior 
when 
installed 
on 
the 
victim 
machine. 
Domains 
observed 
in 
active 
infections 
over 
the 
past 
six 
months. 
We 
also 
make 
a 
larger 


mined 
dataset 
available 
through 
Fidelis 
Barncat, 
a 
malware 
configuration 
intelligence 
database 
shared 
at 
no 
cost 
with 
trusted 
third 
parties. 
Artifacts 
correlating 
Hworm 
C2 
domains 
with 
njRAT, 
XtremeRAT 
and 
DarkComet. 
Yara 
rules 
that 
can 
be 
used 
to 
detect 
the 
VBS 
and 
PE 
versions 
of 
H-W0rm. 


The

is 
a

A 
Worm 
That's 
Really 
a 
RAT 


It 
is 
worth 
clarifying 
that 
even 
though 
the 
malware 
is 
known 
as 
H-W0rm/Hworm, 
this 
version 
is 
not 
a 
typical 
worm. 
Specifically, 
it 
features 
classic 
Remote 
Access 
Trojan 
capabilities 
that 
allow 
the 
adversary 
to 
fully 
control 
the 
infected 
system. 
Here 
is 
rundown 
of 
some 
of 
these 
capabilities: 



Collect 
system 
information: 
hardware 
ID, 
client 
name/campaign 
code, 
computer 
name, 
operating 
system, 
worm/RAT 
version, 
information 
about 
AV 
installed, 
webcam 
presence, 
etc. 


File 
Manager: 
download, 
rename, 
delete, 
execute 
Remote 
Desktop 
capture/screenshot 
Keylogger 
Collect 
password 
filled 
in 
forms 
from 
web 
browsers, 
such 
as 
Mozilla 
Firefox, 
Google 


Chrome, 
and 
Opera 
Webcam 
Microphone 
Run 
remote 
application 
or 
script 
from

or

or 
load 
it 
in 
memory 
via 
RunPE

Let's 
Go 
to 
the 
Videotape 


A 
YouTube 
video 
shows 
an 
Hworm 
version 
that 
is 
referred 
to 
as 
version 
2. 
The 
following 
is 
a 
screenshot 
from 
one 
of 
the 
windows 
presented 
in 
the 
video: 



The 
Exploit 
panel, 
under 
the 
Builder 
tab, 
looks 
interesting. 
At 
the 
moment, 
it 
is 
unclear 
how 
this 
feature 
works, 
but 
its 
mere 
presence 
suggests 
the 
potential 
for 
creating 
and 
integrating 
future 
exploits 
into 
the 
malware. 
The 
following 
is 
a 
screenshot 
of 
the 
panel: 
Our 
analysis 
found 
that 
one 
of 
the 
samples 
saved 
keystroke 
data 
into 
the 
%TEMP% 
directory 
using 
the 
filename 
[malware_name.dat]. 
In 
this 
instance, 
the 
malware 
was 
configured 
from 
the 
builder 
to 
be 
installed 
in 
the 
%TEMP% 
directory, 
but 
based 
on 
the 
builder 
settings, 
it 
can 
be 
installed 
in 
the 
following 
directories:

The 
malware 
also 
created 
the 
following 
hidden 
folder 
in 
the 
attached 
USB 
drive: 
$RECYCLE.BIN. 


The 
Link 
to 
Houdini 


There 
has 
been 
speculation 
in 
the 
research 
community 
3, 
4, 
5 
that 
"Houdini" 
(aka 
ʻMohamed 
Benabdellahʼ) 
is 
believed 
to 
have 
connection 
with 
“njq8” 
(aka 
ʻNaser 
Al 
Mutairiʼ), 
the 
initial 
developer 
of 
“njRAT” 
and 
“njw0rm”. 
It 
has 
further 
been 
speculated 
that 
"Houdini" 
is 
based 
in 
Algeria 
and 
“njq8” 
in 
Kuwait. 
It 
is 
also 
said 
that 
“njq8” 
has 
a 
connection 
with 
“Black 
Mafia” 
on 
the 
development 
on 
“Black 
Worm”, 
indicating 
potential 
collaboration 
between 
these 
RAT 
developers. 


AV 
Information 
in 
the 
Network 
Traffic 


The 
network 
traffic 
of 
some 
versions 
of 
the 
Hworm 
malware 
contain 
information 
about 
the 
antivirus 
tool 
installed 
in 
the 
victim 
system. 
This 
data 
indicates 
that 
some 
of 
the 
infected 
systems 
appeared 
to 
have 
been 
running 
antivirus 
tools 
like: 



Microsoft 
Security 
Essentials 
Symantec 
Endpoint 
Protection 
McAfee 
VirusScan 
Enterprise 
ESET 
Smart 
Security 
Windows 
Defender 
Normally, 
those 
tools 
will 
detected 
the 
malware, 
but 
for 
some 
unknown 
reason 
it 
looks 
like 
the 
AV 
tools 
didnʼt 
remove 
those 
versions 
of 
the 
Hworm 
malware 
running 
in 
memory. 
Without 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
specific 
Hworm 
version 
in 
the 
victim 
system 
and 
a 
Forensics 
investigation, 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
confirm 
why 
those 
AV 
tools 
didnʼt 
remove 
the 
sample 
from 
those 
victim 
system. 


Protect 
Yourself 


These 
findings 
are 
another 
validation 
of 
how 
a 
layered 
approach 
to 
secure 
the 
network 
enterprise 
is 


needed 
to 
protect 
your 
endpoints 
from 
these 
cyber 
threats. 
In 
order 
to 
aid 
the 
security 
community 
with 
indicators 
of 
the 
Hworm 
RAT, 
the 
following 
is 
a

From 
the 
above 
domains, 
the 
following 
one 
quickly 
stands 
out: 
“ 
njrat2012.no-ip[dot]biz”. 
The 
last 
Hworm 
activity 
observed 
at 
a 
client 
site 
with 
this 
domain 
was 
on 
Oct 
2016. 
pDNS 
data 
shows 
that 
in 
June 
2016 
this 
domain 
was 
associated 
with 
Xtreme 
RAT 
activity. 
We 
also 
found 
samples 
of 
njRAT 
v.0.7d 
and 
v.0.4.1a 
beaconing 
to 
this 
domain. 
The 
following 
table 
shows 
some 
of 
the 
C2 
correlations:
