Targeted 
attacks 
are 
visibly 
commoditizing, 
choosing 
cost 
efficiency 
over 
sophistication. 
If 
a� 
combination 
of 
social 
engineering, 
tweaks 
to 
widely-available 
malware 
and 
legit 
apps 
can 
do 
the 
trick, 
why 
bother 
to 
create 
something 
original 
and 
exquisite? 


Nevertheless 
there 
remain 
true 
adepts 
– 
those 
who 
perceive 
every 
cyberespionage 
operation 
as 
another 
stage 
in 
the 
quest 
for 
ultimate 
perfection. 
And, 
given 
the 
long 
and 
successful 
careers 
of 
some, 
they 
have 
good 
reason 
to 
stick 
with 
their 
own 
way 
of 
working. 



Artistic 
Blackmailers 


The 
Poseidon 
cyberespionage 
group 
very 
much 
fits 
this 
description. 
The 
group 
has 
been 
using 
state-� 
of-the-art 
custom 
malware 
since 
2005, 
at 
least, 
and 
there’s 
data 
to 
suggest 
that 
some 
could 
have 
been 
prototyped 
as 
early 
as 
2001. 
Different 
components 
of 
their 
toolsets 
appeared 
regularly 
on 
the 
radar 
of 
security 
companies, 
but 
were 
not 
recognized 
as 
part 
of 
a 
bigger 
picture. 
Throughout 
this 
period, 
Poseidon 
were 
meticulously 
tailoring 
their 
toolsets 
to 
ensure 
easy 
and 
silent 
entry 
and 
efficient� 
data 
acquisition, 
in 
line 
with 
their 
patrons’ 
requirements. 
This 
perfectionist, 
artisan 
approach, 
together 
with 
the 
group’s 
known 
fascination 
with 
Greek 
mythology 
and 
their 
one-time 
abuse 
of 
a 
maritime 
satellite 
communications 
system, 
earned 
their 
operations 
the 
nickname 
‘Poseidon’s 
APT 
Boutique’.

Setting 
aside 
their 
artistic 
finesse, 
some 
aspects 
of 
their 
‘business 
model’ 
looked 
distinctly 
ugly.� 
Masquerading 
behind 
a 
front-end 
‘security 
company’, 
they 
used 
harvested 
secrets 
to 
blackmail 
targets 
into 
accepting 
them 
as 
IT 
security 
contractors. 
Meanwhile, 
they 
either 
retained 
an 
illegitimate 
presence 
within 
the 
‘secured’ 
system 
or, 
having 
completed 
the 
task 
agreed, 
quietly 
resumed 
their 
presence 
within 
the 
perimeter. 
They 
were 
known 
to 
refer 
to 
one 
element 
their 
business 
cycle 
as 



‘financial 
forcasting’, 
giving 
an 
idea 
of 
the 
long-term 
benefit 
they 
anticipated 
from 
a 
prolonged 
systems 
presence. 
With 
their 
focus 
on 
Windows-based 
systems 
and 
extremely 
developed 
skills, 
they 
could 
theoretically 
embed 
themselves 
within 
the 
victim’s 
IT 
system 
for 
years 
without 
being 
detected. 



Great 
Art 
Demands 
Sacrifices� 


The 
Poseidon’s 
targets 
have 
tended 
to 
be 
large 
Enterprises, 
mainly 
centering 
round 
Brazil, 
the 
US, 
France, 
Kazakhstan 
and 
Russia. 
There 
appears 
an 
interesting 
language 
limitation 
to 
English 
and 
Brazilian 
Portuguese 
based 
systems: 
even 
in 
countries 
with 
different 
national 
languages, 
the 
IT 
networks 
of 
multi-national 
corporations 
having 
these 
locales 
and/or 
keyboard 
layouts 
were 
preferred 
as 
targets. 
Their 
sphere 
of 
interest 
has 
encompassed 
Energy 
and 
Utilities, 
Manufacturing 
– 
and 
also 
Media 
and 
PR. 
The 
latter 
two 
could 
obviously 
provide 
attackers 
with 
plenty 
of 
information 
for 
use 
as 
ammunition 
against 
additional 
future 
targets.

Tools 
of 
the 
Artisan’s 
Trade 


To 
many 
an 
artisan 
eye, 
elegance 
and 
simplicity 
go 
hand 
by 
hand. 
The 
Poseidon 
group 
seem 
to 
embrace 
this 
principle. 
For 
initial 
penetration, 
they 
use 
no 
exploits; 
only 
well-crafted 
spear-phishing 



emails 
carrying 
DOC/RTF 
files 
with 
encapsulated 
executables 
– 
an 
uncommon 
approach 
nowadays.� 
To 
fool 
existing 
security 
solutions, 
they 
often 
sign 
these 
binaries 
with 
real 
certificates 
– 
issued 
for 
fake� 
companies 
or 
even 
belonging 
to 
genuine 
well-respected 
and 
trusted 
organizations. 
Having 
successfully 
infecting 
their 
first 
victims, 
the 
collection 
of 
extensive 
data 
about 
the 
attacked� 
infrastructure 
begins. 
Using 
this 
information, 
and 
ace 
Windows 
admin 
skills, 
the 
attackers 
can 
then 
move 
laterally 
without 
triggering 
any 
alarms, 
their 
next 
objective 
being 
to 
obtain 
Domain 
Admin 
rights. 
With 
this 
level 
of 
power, 
they 
can 
then 
purge 
the 
majority 
of 
their 
own 
tools 
from 
the 
network, 
retaining 
only 
those 
essential 
to 
their 
ongoing 
presence 
and 
data 
exfiltration.� 


As 
already 
mentioned, 
in 
one 
series 
of 
operations 
Poseidon 
used 
ships’ 
satellite 
communication 
systems 
as 
hiding 
places 
for 
their 
Command 
& 
Control 
(C&C) 
servers, 
a 
similar 
mechanism 
to 
that 
used 
by 
the 
Turla 
actor. 
No 
attempts 
to 
repeat 
this 
feat 
have, 
however, 
been 
recorded. 



What 
Can 
Be 
Done? 


Despite 
all 
Poseidon’s 
attempts 
to 
disguise 
and 
disperse 
the 
evidence, 
experts 
from 
Kaspersky 
Lab’s 
Global 
Research 
and 
Analysis 
Team 
have 
succeeded 
in 
piecing 
all 
the 
disparate 
pieces 
of 
data 
into 
a 
complete 
picture. 
Still, 
the 
Poseidon 
group 
remains 
active, 
which 
brings 
us 
to 
the 
question 
of 
adequate 
defense. 


Of 
course 
protecting 
endpoints 
is 
a 
must 
– 
which, 
as 
the 
well-known 
ASD 
Mitigation 
Strategies 
suggest, 
should 
comprise 
non-signature 
detection 
mechanisms, 
such 
as 
Heuristics 
and 
Behavioral 
Detection 
Algorithms. 
Possessing 
all 
these, 
Kaspersky 
Endpoint 
Security 
for 
Business 
is 
powered 
by 
the 
same 
superior 
Security 
Intelligence 
that 
enabled 
our 
experts 
to 
piece 
together 
the 
previously 
insoluble 
Poseidon 
puzzle. 
Kaspersky 
Endpoint 
Security 
for 
Business 
also 
provides 
further 
proactive 



security 
layers 
– 
including 
Security 
Controls, 
HIPS 
and 
a 
built-in 
Application 
Firewall 
– 
all 
fed 
by 
real-time 
global 
intelligence 
from 
the 
Kaspersky 
Security 
Network. 
These 
layers 
erect 
further 
barriers 
in 
the 
path 
of 
malware, 
from 
blocking 
launch 
attempts 
to 
preventing 
access 
to 
critical 
system 
elements 
and 
communications 
with 
C&C. 


The 
extent 
of 
information 
harvesting 
by 
the 
Poseidon 
group 
also 
highlights 
the 
benefits 
of 
Data� 
Encryption 
throughout 
the 
whole 
corporate 
infrastructure, 
enforced 
by 
appropriate 
policies. 
The 
Advanced 
tier 
of 
Kaspersky 
Endpoint 
Security 
for 
Business 
includes 
easy-to-use 
Encryption 
Technology, 
managed 
through 
the 
same 
single-pane-of-glass 
console 
of 
Kaspersky 
Security 
Center 
as 
all 
platform 
elements. 
Of 
course, 
with 
spear-phishing 
as 
the 
penetration 
method 
of 
choice 
for 
the 
majority 
of 
Targated 
Attack 
groups, 
scanning 
email 
streams 
is 
also 
absolutely 
crucial 
nowadays. 
Kaspersky 
Security 
for 
Mail 
Servers 
erects 
another 
powerful 
defensive 
wall 
in 
the 
attacker’s 
way. 


All 
in 
all, 
Kaspersky 
Lab’s 
portfolio 
of 
solutions 
helps 
implement 
19 
of 
ASD’s 
35 
Mitigation 
Strategies, 
including 
3 
of 
the 
‘top 
4’ 
which 
between 
them 
prevent 
85% 
Targeted 
Attack-related 
incidents. 
But 
even 
if 
you 
use 
another 
vendor’s 
solutions 
to 
protect 
your 
infrastructure, 
we 
can 
help. 
Kaspersky 
Lab’s 
achievements 
as 
APT 
discoverers 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
presence 
even 
of 
such 
a 
stealthy 
and 
capable 
APT 
actor 
as 
Poseidon 
can 
be 
uncovered; 
that’s 
what 
our 
Targeted 
Attack 
Discovery 
service 
is 
for[1]. 


Secrets 
are 
worth 
most 
when 
they’re 
sold 
red 
hot. 
Perhaps 
it’s 
time 
to 
prevent 
your 
organization 
from 
getting 
burned.
