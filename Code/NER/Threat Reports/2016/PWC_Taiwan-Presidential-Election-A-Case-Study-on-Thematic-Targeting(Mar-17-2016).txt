Executive 
Summary 
In 
January 
2016, 
Tsai 
Ingwen 
was 
elected 
as 
the 
first 
female 
president 
of 
Taiwan. 
Prior 
to 
the 
election, 
it 
was 
reported 
that 
the 
election 
was 
going 
to 
be 
the 
target 
of 
a 
series 
of 
attacks 
by 
Chinese 
threat 
actors.[1] 
Looking 
back 
on 
the 
malware 
observed 
from 
different 
groups 
over 
that 
period 
of 
time, 
we 
have 
been 
able 
to 
piece 
together 
evidence 
which 
suggests 
that 
several 
distinct 
threat 
actors 
launched 
attacks 
using 
the 
Taiwan 
presidential 
election 
as 
a 
spear 
phishing 
theme. 
This 
blog 
post 
provides 
an 
overview 
of 
the 
malware 
and 
the 
network 
infrastructure 
associated 
with 
the 
threat 
actors 
who 
have 
taken 
advantage 
of 
this 
event.

The 
first 
sample 
we 
came 
across 
using 
the 
Taiwan 
election 
theme 
was 
an 
Excel 
spreadsheet 
named 
2016年台灣總統選舉觀戰團行程 
Once 
the 
spreadsheet 
is 
executed, 
a 
file 
called

E

is 
dropped 
in 
the 


processcreatesasetofregistrykeysanddropsI%userpro
folder. 
The 
file 
is 
in 
fact 
an 
executable 
binary 
which, 
once 
executed, 
spawns 
a 
ctfmon.exe 
process 
and 
clones 
itself

same

The 


naming 
convention 
of 
this 
file 
has 
been 
reported 
as 
distinctive 
to 
the 
IXESHE[3] 
and 
the 
related 
Etumbot[4] 
malware 
family, 
and 
it 
is 
based 
on 
the 


behavioral 
similarity 
with 
other 
Etumbot 
samples 
(e.g.

a 
decoy 
document 
is 
also 
created 
and 
displayed 
to 
the 
victim 
as 
shown 
below. 
Research 
on 
the 
content 
of 
the 
decoy 


document 
shows 
that 
the 
content 
is 
likely 
to 
have 
been 
taken 
from 
a 
presentation 
with 


the 
same 
title, 
“總統辯論會後：民眾政黨支持趨勢變化 
”, 
originally 
written 
by 
TaiwanThinkTank.[5] 
The 
figure 
below 
shows 
the 
same 
content 
from 
the 
presentation 
being 
used 
in 
the 
decoy 
document. 
The 
lack 
of 
formatting 
in 
the 
decoy 
document 
suggests 
that 
the 
attacker 
simply 
copied 
and 
pasted 
the 
content 
from 
the 
PDF 
to 
create 
a 
new 
Word 
document. 
The 
similarity 
of 
the 
content 
is 
as 
shown 
below:

named

(09ddd70517cb48a46d9f93644b29c72f). 
The 
content 
of 
this

contains 
two 
blank

(Figure

however, 
once 
a 
selfextracting

(SFX) 
is 
dropped, 
a 
separate 
decoy 
document 
is 
displayed 
which 
contains 
one 
line 
of 
text 
that 
mentions 
the 
presidential 
election.

the 
subsequent

displayed 
to 
the

(bottom). 


However, 
the 
sentence 
is 
nonsensical 
and 
it 
reads 
as 
if 
the 
attacker 
simply 
concatenated 
a 
few 
unrelated 
lines 
together. 
Interestingly, 
a 
search 
for 
the 
sentences 
revealed 
that 
it 
had 
been 
used 
as 
the 
title 
of 
a 
spear 
phishing 
email 
sent 
to 
a 
number 
of 
politicians 
and 
activists 
in

James 
To[8], 
Tommy 
Cheung[9] 
and 
Joshua 
Wong.[10] 
Wong 
is 
a 
wellknown 
student 
activist 
in 
Hong 
Kong 
and 
he 
publicly 
announced 
on 
Facebook 
on 
6th 
January 
2016 
that 
he 
had 
received 
the 
spear 
phishing 
email 
but 
was 
not 
tricked 
into 
opening 
the 
.rar 
attachment 
(Figure 
11), 
which 
shares 
the 
same 
filename 
as 
the 
document 
file 
referenced 
in 
Figure 
10.

The

title 
is 
identical 
to 
the 
line 
shown 
in 
the 
decoy 
document 
dropped 
by 
the 
analysed 
sample. 


Examining 
the 
EXIF 
data 
of 
the 
decoy 
document 
dropped 
by 
our 
sample 
shows 
that 
the 
document 
was 
created 
on 
the 
same 
day 
as 
the 
spear 
phishing 
email 
was 
sent.

EXIF 
data 
of 
the 
decoy

highlight 
the 
similarity 
in 
timing 
of 
the 
attack. 


Given 
similarities 
in 
the 
theme 
and 
text 
used 
in 
the 
spear 
phish, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
timing 
of 
the 
campaign 
against 
the 
Hong 
Kong 
activist 
and 
the 
creation 
time 
of 
the 
decoy 
document, 
we 
believe 
both 
attacks 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
the 
same. 


Returning

our

once

be 
a

the

Another 
interesting 
observable 
from 
the

sample 
is 
a 
call 
to 
a 
DLL 
function, 


, 
which 
is 
hardcoded 
in 
the 
malware.

called

which 
is 
hardcoded 
in 
the 
malware. 


Although 
we 
were 
unable 
to 
find 
direct 
overlap 
in 
network 
infrastructure 
used 
by 
our 
SunOrcal 
sample

other 
threat 
actors, 
we 
were 
able 
to 
identify 
other 
SunOrcal

which 
have 
shared 
network 
infrastructure 
with 
the 
Surtr 
malware, 
previously 
reported 
by 
Citizen 
Labs[13] 
back 
in 
2013. 


In 
particular, 
by 
finding 
samples 
that 
create 
the 
same 
folder 
names 
“j

and 
“

we

Figure
19: 
List 
of 
domains 
registered 
using 
the 
email 
address 
toucan6712@163.com. 
Based 
on 
the 
use 
of 
the 
same 
registrant 
email 
address 
that 
is 
associated 
with 
only 
a 
small 
number 
of 
domains 
with 
related 
themes 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
targeting 
of 
Tibet 
and 
Hong 
Kong, 
both 
of 
which 
are 
autonomous 
regions 
that 
have 
been 
problematic 
to 
China’s 
internal 
security, 
we 
believe 
with 
high 
confidence 
that 
both 
SunOrcal 
and 
Surtr 
RATs 
are 
used 
by 
the 
same 
threat 
actor. 
Based 
on 
the 
creation 
date 
of 
some 
of 
the 
domains, 
we 
believe 
the 
threat 
actor 
has 
been 
active 
as 
early 
as 
2010. 


Conclusion 


Spear 
phishing 
has 
long 
been 
one 
of 
the 
most 
common 
and 
effective 
ways 
in 
which 
an 
attacker 
can 
deliver 
malware 
on 
to 
victim 
machines 
to 
compromise 
target 
organisations. 
The 
success 
or 
failure 
of 
this 
technique 
relies 
on 
the 
ability 
of 
attackers 
to 
trick 
victims 
into 
opening 
the 
malicious 
attachment 
and 
this 
is 
why 
highprofile 
events 
and 
headlines 
are 
often 
used 
as 
lures. 


As 
with 
other 
highprofile 
events, 
the 
Taiwanese 
presidential 
election 
in 
January 
was 
no 
different. 
In 
this 
blog 
post, 
we 
have 
shown 
that 
three 
distinct 
espionage 
threat 
actors 
have 
used 
the 
election 
as 
theme 
to 
lure 
their 
victims 
into 
opening 
the 
malicious 
documents. 
This 
highlights 
the 
importance 
of 
security 
awareness 
training 
to 
ensure 
staff 
members, 
particularly 
those 
with 
access 
to 
sensitive 
information, 
remain 
vigilant 
in 
order 
to 
help 
defend 
against 
wellcrafted 
spearphishing 
attacks.
