The 
Esile 
targeted 
attack 
campaign 
targeting 
various 
countries 
in 
the 
SoutheastAsian 
region 
has 
been 
discussed 
in 
the 
media 
recently. 
This 
campaign 
– 
which 
was 
referred 
to 
by 
other 
researchers 
as 
Lotus 
Blossom 
– 
is 
believed 
to 
be 
the 
work 
of 
a 
nation-state 
actor 
due 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
stolen 
information, 
which 
is 
more 
valuable 
to 
countries 
than 
either 
private 
companies 
or 
cybercriminals. 


The 
PaloAlto 
Networks 
report 
discussed 
a 
targeted 
attack 
campaign 
that 
has 
been 
known 
to 
Trend 
Micro 
researchers 
for 
some 
time. 
We 
noted 
in 
our 
earlier 
targeted 
attack 
trends 
report 
that 
this 
particular 
campaign 
– 
which 
is 
known 
as 
the 
Elise/Esile 
campaign 
elsewhere 
– 
was 
already 
in 
use 
in 
2012. 
Other 
researchers 
have 
noted 
that 
this 
campaign 
was 
active 
as 
early 
as 
2007. 
This 
campaign 
and 
the 
tools 
used 
are 
familiar 
to 
Trend 
Micro, 
and 
we 
have 
developed 
appropriate 
solutions 
for 
this 
threat. 


ESILE 
In 
A 
Nutshell 


Our 
detection 
for 
the 
malware 
family 
used 
in 
the 
Elise 
campaign 
is 
BKDR_ESILE. 
Their 
arrival 
and 
behavior 
patterns 
are 
quite 
consistent: 
they 
arrive 
via 
a 
malicious 
Office 
document 
sent 
through 
spear-
phishing. 
In 
many 
cases, 
these 
documents 
claim 
to 
be 
official 
government 
papers 
to 
make 
it 
more 
attractive 
for 
users 
to 
open 
these 
files. 


If 
the 
document 
is 
opened, 
an 
exploit 
is 
used 
to 
execute 
a 
dropper 
(SetElise) 
on 
the 
system. 
This 
dropper 
is 
run 
and 
tries 
to 
establish 
persistence 
for 
the 
resident 
component 
(EliseDLL). 
It 
will 
first 
try 
to 
create 
a 
Windows 
service 
to 
start 
EliseDLL. 
Failing 
that, 
it 
will 
drop 
a 
loader 
(LoadElise) 
and 
then 
add 
an 
autorun 
registry 
entry 
to 
bring 
up 
the 
loader 
every 
time 
the 
system 
boots 
up. 


The 
diagram 
below 
provides 
an 
overview 
of 
ESILE’s 
architecture: 



Figure 
1. 
ESILE 
architecture 


The 
initial 
command-and-control 
server 
information 
is 
embedded 
within 
the 
dropper. 
The 
string 
DA76C979 
or 
DF72YR0V 
is 
used 
as 
a 
marker 
for 
this 
information, 
which 
is 
located 
40 
bytes 
after 
the 
start 
of 
the 
tag. 
The 
file 
names 
of 
the 
loader 
and 
EliseDLLare 
also 
contained 
within 
the 
dropper. 


One 
unique 
attribute 
of 
ESILE 
is 
that 
it 
(poorly) 
attempts 
to 
randomize 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
dropped 
files. 
Specifically, 
the 
created, 
last 
accessed, 
and 
last 
modified 
dates 
are 
all 
modified 
by 
the 
dropper. 
The 
dates 
used 
are 
randomly 
generated 
based 
on 
the 
following 
algorithm: 


1. 
The 
year 
for 
these 
dates 
is 
set 
to 
2007.

The 
day/hour/minute/second/millisecond 
fields 
are 
set 
using 
a 
random 
number 
generator 
(RNG). 
The 
seed 
for 
this 
RNG 
is 
set 
to 
the 
year 
of 
the 
dropper’s 
release 
– 
i.e., 
a 
2012 
dropper 
will 
use 
2012 
as 
the 
seed. 
Because 
of 
the 
fixed 
seed, 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
dropped 
files 
are 
not 
actually 
random, 
although 
at 
first 
glance 
they 
may 
appear 
to 
be. 
This 
may 
have 
been 
done 
to 
attempt 
to 
confuse 
security 
tools 
and 
researchers. 


Another 
unusual 
property 
of 
ESILE 
malware 
is 
that 
some 
versions 
contain 
strings 
in 
their 
resources 
that, 
in 
effect, 
act 
as 
fingerprints 
that 
identify 
them 
as 
ESILE. 
These 
strings 
are: 



Elise 
Install 
Version 
1.0 
Copyright 
(C) 
2012 


Command 
and 
Control 


As 
is 
generally 
the 
case 
with 
backdoors, 
ESILE 
contacts 
a 
command-and-control 
server 
in 
order 
to 
receive 
commands 
from 
its 
attacker. 
How 
it 
does 
this 
is 
also 
a 
fingerprint 
of 
the 
campaign 
as 
well. 
It 
uses 
a 
URLbased 
on 
the 
MAC 
address 
of 
the 
infected 
machine’s 
network 
interface, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
current 
time. 


For 
example: 
a 
victim’s 
machine 
uses 
the 
MAC 
address 
00-00-07-08-09-0Aand 
attempts 
to 
connect 
to 
the 
C&C 
server 
at 
2015-01-02 
03:04:05. 
The 
URLused 
will 
be 
http://{C&C 
server}:443/708090A/page_02030405.html. 


This 
distinctive 
pattern 
can 
be 
used 
to 
help 
spot 
and 
block 
ESILE-related 
endpoints 
on 
an 
organization’s 
network.
