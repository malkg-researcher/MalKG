Picture
“APT” Groups: Groups conducting network 
operations on behalf of a nation state. Includes 
cyber espionage and network attack activity. 

Picture
“FIN” Groups: Well organized, capable 
intrusion teams that conduct intrusions for 
financial gain. Seek to steal information that 
can be monetized.

TTPs: “Tactics, Techniques and Procedures” –the “toolkit” 
and methods threat actors use to achieve their objectives.

Why Does Exposure Matter? 

Security vendors sprint to detect publicized 
activity
Net defenders more likely to hunt in their 
networks for evidence of a group, employ new 
IOCs or detection methods 




Exposure triggers public awareness and increases threat groups’ risk of 
detection/discovery.

Public spotlight creates a flashpoint 
of awareness of a group’s ops, TTPS

Why Does Exposure Matter –Big Picture 

What ethical boundaries and obligations do 
security researchers face? 
Are we cultivating better OPSEC in the actors 
we expose? 
What is the best way to share? 
Mission vs. Marketing

Key Concept

“Response from adversaries to perceived safeguards 
and/or countermeasures, in which the adversaries 
change some characteristic of their [operations] in 
order to avoid and/or overcome those 
safeguards/countermeasures”

Threat groups are often keenly aware of 
research & reporting on their operations.

More than an exposure effort:

-Coalition sought to eradicate specific ‘high value’ tools and 
make it more expensive for APT17 to operate 
-Coordinated action was accompanied by public materials to 
aid detection and educate victims 






Operation SMN coalition went into the 
effort with eyes wide open:

-Acknowledged from outset that APT17 was skilled, equipped 
to adapt and would very likely retool

Hide and Seek: How Threat Actors Respond in the 
Face of Public Exposure 

Threat actors are often keenly aware of reporting on 
their operations
Exposure can disrupt an actor’s operations… if the 
incentives are right. 
Public reporting triggers retooling 
Actors may abandon tools or develop new ones.
The path of least resistance is often king.


Sometimes, actors solve the problem by adding 
resources: time, money, tool development


Key Takeaways 


#RSAC

transition slide little piece on the right-01.png
Exposure is a 
balancing act 

Security researchers must continually weigh 
the benefits of public awareness against 
possible disruptions to detection and loss of 
visibility. 

When executed well, exposure benefits 
victims, network defenders and the security 
community at large. 

Hide and Seek: How Threat Actors Respond in the 
Face of Public Exposure 


#RSAC

transition slide little piece on the right-01.png
Questions to Ask 

-What impact do we want to have on the adversary? 
-How will exposure help/hurt victims and likely future 
targets? 
-How will exposure impact ‘big picture’ concerns like 
law enforcement efforts? 
-Will exposure degrade our ability to detect and 
respond to future activity?




-How adaptive and capable is the group? 
-Groups with a flat toolset and low adaptive 
capability are more likely to be disrupted 


-How determined are they to maintain access to 
specific targets? 
-What shifts to targeting, timing, resourcing & TTPs 
is the actor likely to make?




When evaluating whether exposing an adversary 
is the best course of action: 

When evaluating how a threat actor will likely 
respond when their operations are exposed:
