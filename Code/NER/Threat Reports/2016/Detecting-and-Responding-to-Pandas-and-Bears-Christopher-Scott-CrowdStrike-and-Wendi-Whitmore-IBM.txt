Collect data from one machine

Clean entire network before 
beginning to remediate


Conduct forensics for months before 
containment of the adversary


Not So Long Ago


Today


Track attackers and actively 
hunt for them in real

on Day 1 of IR


Contain
the adversary quickly



INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE ARE JUST 
THE BEGINNING. WE NEED TO TRACK 
HUMAN BEHAVIORS AND ATTACK

WE NEED TO 
COMBINE IOC AND IOA METHODOLOGIES

Forces attackers to change behaviors


Not all behaviors change 
-
good 
intel
and pattern 
analysis can identify the new TTPs


Analysts need the ability to tailor 
intel
and extract relevance via tools and 
skillsets


Understanding your adversaries helps you gain 
focus and understand what 
intel
is relevant

What are adversaries adjusting to?

DETERMINING MULTIPLE ADVERSARIES


•
Why would you care?
–
Understand who is targeting your intellectual property
–
Plan to spend your security budget better
–
Employ more effective containment and mitigation strategies
•
What areas of the kill chain is the adversary targeting?
•
Where is the weakness?




•
What would better help you identify?
–
Context of the incident
•
M & A, Franchises, Development Plans


–
Malware tools used
–
Sequencing of commands
–
Known C2 channels





THE SPEED OF CONTAINMENT


•
Why?
–
Intellectual property leaving the building during the attack
–
What makes you unique is quickly being taken
–
Containment is not “Remediation”


•
How?
–
Visibility, Visibility, Visibility
–
Isolate in real time
–
New technologies allow for this
–
Look at the IOAs
•
Where in the attack cycle?




•
When?
–
As soon as possible
–
Before forensics is complete? YES. Are you crazy? No.





Not every adversary group is created 
equal. 
Groups have differing skills, 
resources, and capabilities.


Do not fit data into your expectations 
–
Look for anomalies in your findings 
focusing on timing, behavior, and 
tradecraft


The likelihood of being targeted by 
multiple adversaries is high. 
In this 
example, remediation had to include both 
actors simultaneously!

THE TAKEAWAYS



REMEDIATION PLANNING 
SHOULD COINCIDE WITH 
INITIAL 
INCIDENT RESPONSE



REMEDIATION ACTIONS


•
All Adversaries
–
Privileged Account Control
•
Think outside of the box on ways to do this


–
Blacklisting known IOCs?
•
What is the effort vs the reward?


–
Service Accounts
•
Can you reset them?
•
Who has the source code?
•
How long to fix it?







REMEDIATION ACTIONS


•
Where is the adversary in the kill chain?
•
The earlier in the kill chain, the more options at your disposal.
–
Visibility, Visibility, 
Visibilty
–
If you can find them at: exploitation, installation, command and control
•
You can stop them quickly


–
If you understand the pattern of the attack you have additional options
•
Anticipate the next move
•
Use the intel you collected
