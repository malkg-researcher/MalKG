In 
March 
2016, 
Symantec 
published 
a 
blog 
on 
Suckfly, 
an 
advanced 
cyberespionage 
group􀀀that 
conducted 
attacks 
against 
a 
number 
of 
South 
Korean 
organizations 
to 
steal 
digital 
certificates. 
Since 
then 
we 
have 
identified 
a 
number� 
of 
attacks 
over 
a 
two-year 
period, 
beginning 
in 
April 
2014, 
which 
we 
attribute 
to 
Suckfly. 
The 
attacks 
targeted 
high-� 
profile 
targets, 
including 
government 
and 
commercial 
organizations. 
These 
attacks 
occurred 
in 
several 
different� 
countries, 
but 
our 
investigation 
revealed 
that 
the 
primary 
targets 
were 
individuals 
and 
organizations 
primarily 
located 
in 
India. 
While 
there 
have 
been 
several 
Suckfly 
campaigns 
that 
infected 
organizations 
with 
the 
group’s 
custom 
malware� 
Backdoor.Nidiran, 
the 
Indian 
targets 
show 
a 
greater 
amount 
of 
post-infection 
activity 
than 
targets 
in 
other 
regions. 
This 
suggests 
that 
these 
attacks 
were 
part 
of 
a 
planned 
operation 
against 
specific 
targets 
in 
India.� 
Campaign 
activity 
in 
India 
The 
first 
known 
Suckfly 
campaign 
began 
in 
April 
of 
2014. 
During 
our 
investigation 
of 
the 
campaign, 
we 
identified 
a� 
number 
of 
global 
targets 
across 
several 
industries 
who 
were 
attacked 
in 
2015. 
Many 
of 
the 
targets 
we 
identified� 
were 
well 
known 
commercial 
organizations 
located 
in 
India. 
These 
organizations 
included: 
One 
of 
India's 
largest 
financial 
organizations� 
A 
large 
e-commerce 
company 
The 
e-commerce 
company's 
primary 
shipping 
vendor 
One 
of 
India's 
top 
five 
IT 
firms� 
A 
United 
States 
healthcare 
provider's 
Indian 
business 
unit 
Two 
government 
organizations 
Suckfly 
spent 
more 
time 
attacking 
the 
government 
networks 
compared 
to 
all 
but 
one 
of 
the 
commercial 
targets.� 
Additionally, 
one 
of 
the 
two 
government 
organizations 
had 
the 
highest 
infection 
rate 
of 
the 
Indian 
targets.

Indian 
government 
org

is 
responsible 
for 
implementing 
network 
software 
for 
different 
ministries 
and 
departments 
within 
India's 
central 
government. 
The 
high 
infection 
rate 
for 
this 
target 
is 
likely 
because 
of 
its 
access 
to 
technology 
and 
information 
related 
to 
other 
Indian 
government 
organizations. 


Suckfly's 
attacks 
on 
government 
organizations 
that 
provide 
information 
technology 
services 
to 
other 
government� 
branches 
is 
not 
limited 
to 
India. 
It 
has 
conducted 
attacks 
on 
similar 
organizations 
in 
Saudi 
Arabia, 
likely 
because 
of 
the 
access 
that 
those 
organizations 
have. 


Suckfly's 
targets 
are 
displayed 
in 
figure

by 
their 
industry, 
which 
provides 
a 
clearer 
view 
of 
the 
group’s 
operations.� 
Most 
of 
the

are 
focused 
on 
government 
or 
technology 
related 
companies 
and 
organizations.

One 
of 
the 
attacks

investigated 
provided 
detailed 
insight 
into 
how 
Suckfly 
conducts 
its 
operations. 
In 
2015,� 
Suckfly 
conducted 
a 
multistage 
attack 
between 
April 
22 
and 
May 
4 
against 
an 
e-commerce 
organization 
based 
in� 
India. 
Similar 
to 
its 
other 
attacks, 
Suckfly 
used 
the 
Nidiran 
back 
door 
along 
with 
a 
number 
of 
hacktools 
to 
infect 
the� 
victim's 
internal 
hosts. 
The 
tools 
and 
malware 
used 
in 
this

commerce 
company's 
internal 
network. 
We 
don't 
have 
hard 
evidence 
of 
how 
Suckfly 
obtained 
information 
on� 
the 
targeted 
user, 
but 
we 
did 
find 
a 
large 
open-source 
presence 
on 
the 
initial 
target. 
The 
target's 
job 
function,� 
corporate 
email 
address, 
information 
on 
work 
related 
projects, 
and 
publicly 
accessible 
personal 
blog 
could 
all 
be 
freely 
found 
online. 


2. 
On 
April 
22, 
2015, 
Suckfly 
exploited 
a 
vulnerability 
on 
the 
targeted 
employee's 
operating 
system 
(Windows)� 
that 
allowed 
the 
attackers 
to 
bypass 
the 
User 
Account 
Control 
and 
install 
the 
Nidiran 
back 
door 
to 
provide 
access 
for 
their 
attack. 
While 
we 
know 
the 
attackers 
used 
a 
custom 
dropper 
to 
install 
the 
back 
door, 
we 
do 
not 
know 
the 
delivery 
vector. 
Based 
on 
the 
amount 
of 
open-source 
information 
available 
on 
the 
target, 
it 
is 
feasible 
that 
a 
spear-phishing 
email 
may 
have 
been 
used. 
3. 
After 
the 
attackers 
successfully 
exploited 
the 
employee’s 
system, 
they 
gained 
access 
to 
the 
e-commerce 
company's 
internal 
network. 
We 
found 
evidence 
that 
Suckfly 
used 
hacktools 
to 
move 
latterly 
and 
escalate� 
privileges. 
To 
do 
this 
the 
attackers 
used 
a 
signed 
credential-dumping 
tool 
to 
obtain 
the 
victim's 
account 
credentials. 
With 
the 
account 
credentials, 
the 
attackers 
were 
able 
to 
access 
the 
victim's 
account 
and 
navigate 
the 
internal 
corporate 
network 
as 
though 
they 
were 
the 
employee. 
4. 
On 
April 
27, 
the 
attackers 
scanned 
the 
corporate 
internal 
network 
for 
hosts 
with 
ports 
8080, 
5900, 
and 
40 
open. 
Ports 
8080 
and 
5900 
are 
common 
ports 
used 
with 
legitimate 
protocols, 
but 
can 
be 
abused 
by 
attackers 
when 
they 
are 
not 
secured. 
It 
isn't 
clear 
why 
the 
attackers 
scanned 
for 
hosts 
with 
port 
40 
open 
because 
there 
isn't 
a 
common 
protocol 
assigned 
to 
this 
port. 
Based 
on 
Suckfly 
scanning 
for 
common 
ports, 
it’s 
clear� 
that 
the 
group 
was 
looking 
to 
expand 
its 
foothold 
on 
the 
e-commerce 
company's 
internal 
network. 
5. 
The 
attackers’ 
final 
step 
was 
to 
exfiltrate 
data 
off 
the 
victim’s 
network 
and 
onto 
Suckfly’s 
infrastructure. 
While� 
we 
know 
that 
the 
attackers 
used 
the 
Nidiran 
back 
door 
to 
steal 
information 
about 
the 
compromised 
organization, 
we 
do 
not 
know 
if 
Suckfly 
was 
successful 
in 
stealing 
other 
information.� 
These 
steps 
were 
taken 
over 
a 
13-day 
period, 
but 
only 
on 
specific 
days. 
While 
tracking 
what 
days 
of 
the 
week� 
Suckfly 
used 
its 
hacktools, 
we 
discovered 
that 
the 
group 
was 
only 
active 
Monday 
through 
Friday. 
There 
was 
no� 
activity 
from 
the 
group 
on 
weekends. 
We 
were 
able 
to 
determine 
this 
because 
the 
attackers’ 
hacktools 
are 
command 
line 
driven 
and 
can 
provide 
insight 
into 
when 
the 
operators 
are 
behind 
keyboards 
actively 
working. 
Figure 
4

attackers’

week.

This 
activity 
supports 
our 
theory, 
mentioned 
in 
the 
previous 
Suckfly 
blog􀀀, 
that 
this 
is 
a 
professional 
organized 
group 


Suckfly's 
command 
and 
control 
infrastructure� 


Suckfly 
made 
its 
malware 
difficult 
to 
analyze 
to 
prevent 
their 
operations 
from 
being 
detected. 
However, 
we 
were� 
able 
to 
successfully 
analyze 
Suckfly 
malware 
samples 
and 
extract 
some 
of 
the 
communications 
between 
the� 
Nidiran 
back 
door 
and 
the 
Suckfly 
command 
and 
control 
(C&C) 
domains.� 


We 
analyzed 
the 
dropper, 
which 
is 
an 
executable 
that 
contains 
the 
following 
three 
files:� 


1. 
dllhost.exe: 
The 
main 
host 
for 
the 
.dll 
file� 
2. 
iviewers.dll: 
Used 
to 
load 
encrypted 
payloads 
and 
then 
decrypt 
them 
3. 
msfled: 
The 
encrypted 
payload� 
All 
three 
files 
are 
required 
for 
the 
malware 
to 
run 
correctly. 
Once 
the 
malware 
has 
been 
executed, 
it 
checks 
to 
see 
if� 
it 
has 
a 
connection 
to 
the 
internet 
before 
running. 
If 
the 
connection 
test 
is 
successful, 
the 
malware 
runs 
and 
attempts 
to 
communicate 
with 
the 
C&C 
domain 
over 
ports 
443 
and 
8443. 
In 
the 
samples 
we 
analyzed 
we 
found 
the 
port 
and 
C&C 
information 
encrypted 
and 
hardcoded 
into 
the 
Nidiran 
malware 
itself. 
The 
Nidiran 
back 
door 
made 
the 
following 
initial 
communication 
request 
to 
the 
Suckfly 
C&C 
domain:�

The 
interesting 
information 
being 
transmitted 
to 
the 
C&C 
server 
in 
the 
initial 
request 
is 
located 
in 
the

which 
is 
comprised 
of 
the 
following: 



[COOKIE

Suckfly 
C&C 
infrastructure 
information� 
Conclusion 
Suckfly 
targeted 
one 
of 
India’s 
largest 
e-commerce 
companies, 
a 
major 
Indian 
shipping 
company, 
one 
of 
India’s� 
largest 
financial 
organizations, 
and 
an 
IT 
firm 
that 
provides 
support 
for 
India’s 
largest 
stock 
exchange. 
All 
of 
these� 
targets 
are 
large 
corporations 
that 
play 
a 
major 
role 
in 
India’s 
economy. 
By 
targeting 
all 
of 
these 
organizations 
together, 
Suckfly 
could 
have 
had 
a 
much 
larger 
impact 
on 
India 
and 
its 
economy. 
While 
we 
don't 
know 
the� 
motivations 
behind 
the 
attacks, 
the 
targeted 
commercial 
organizations, 
along 
with 
the 
targeted 
government 
organizations, 
may 
point 
in 
this 
direction. 
Suckfly 
has 
the 
resources 
to 
develop 
malware, 
purchase 
infrastructure, 
and 
conduct 
targeted 
attacks 
for 
years� 
while 
staying 
off 
the 
radar 
of 
security 
organizations. 
During 
this 
time 
they 
were 
able 
to 
steal 
digital 
certificates 
from� 
South 
Korean 
companies 
and 
launch 
attacks 
against 
Indian 
and 
Saudi 
Arabian 
government 
organizations. 
There 
is 
no 
evidence 
that 
Suckfly 
gained 
any 
benefits 
from 
attacking 
the 
government 
organizations, 
but 
someone 
else 
may� 
have 
benefited 
from 
these 
attacks.� 
The 
nature 
of 
the 
Suckfly 
attacks 
suggests 
that 
it 
is 
unlikely 
that 
the 
threat 
group 
orchestrated 
these 
attacks 
on 
their 
own. 
We 
believe 
that 
Suckfly 
will 
continue 
to 
target 
organizations 
in 
India 
and 
similar 
organizations 
in 
other� 
countries 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
economic 
insight 
to 
the 
organization 
behind 
Suckfly's 
operations.�
