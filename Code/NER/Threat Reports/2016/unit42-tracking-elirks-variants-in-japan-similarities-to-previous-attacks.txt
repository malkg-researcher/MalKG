used 
in 
this 
series 
of 
attacks

Our

described 
the 
threat 
sharing 
infrastructure 
with 
Elirks 
in 
the 
report. 


As 
of 
this

we 
can 
note 
similarities 
between 
previously 
seen 
Elirks 
attacks 
and 
this 
recent 
case 
in 
Japan.

In 
the 
recent 
case, 
the 
malicious 
attachment

in 
the 
email 
was 
reported 
as 
“E-TKT”. 
We 
found 
similar

in 
the 
previous 
attack 
in 
Taiwan 
inAugust 
2012 
(Figure

We’ve 
also 
seen 
another 
file 
name 
related 
to 
aviation 
at 
Taiwan 
in 
March 
2012. 
Figure

When

it 
displays 
the 
exactly 
same

with 
the 
Figure4, 
exploits 
CVE-2011-0611 
and

Currently, 
we 
have 
found 
no 
reliable 
evidence 
to 
indicate 
the 
same 
adversary 
attacked 
a 
company 
in 
Japan 
in 
2016 
and 
multiple 
organizations 
in 
Taiwan 
in 
2012. 
However, 
we 
can 
see 
some 
resemblances 
between 
the 
two 
attacks. 
In 
both 
cases, 
attackers 
used 
the 
same 
malware 
family, 
crafted 
spear 
phishing 
emails 
in 
a 
similar 
manner, 
and 
seem 
to 
be 
interested 
in 
some 
areas 
related 
to 
aviation. 
We 
have 
been 
seeing 
multiple 
Elirks 
variants 
targeting 
Japan 
in 
the 
last 
few 
years, 
potentially 
indicating 
an 
ongoing 
cyber 
espionage 
campaign. 
We 
will 
keep 
an 
eye 
on 
the 
threat 
actors.
