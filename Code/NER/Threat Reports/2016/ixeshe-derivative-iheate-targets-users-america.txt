Since 
2012, 
we’ve 
been 
keeping 
an 
eye 
on 
the 
IXESHE 
targeted 
attack 
campaign. 
Since 
its 
inception 
in 
2009, 
the 
campaign 
has 
primarily 
targeted 
governments 
and 
companies 
in 
EastAsia 
and 
Germany. 
However, 
the 
campaign 
appears 
to 
have 
shifted 
tactics 
and 
is 
once 
again 
targeting 
users 
in 
the 
United 
States. 


We 
also 
noticed 
that 
there 
were 
some 
changes 
to 
the 
underlying 
behavior 
of 
the 
malware 
used. 
While 
there 
were 
some 
incremental 
improvements 
in 
the 
observed 
behavior 
of 
the 
new 
sample, 
the 
underlying 
pattern 
of 
behavior 
is 
similar 
to 
what 
we 
observed 
earlier 
from 
IXESHE. 


These 
attacks 
targeting 
users 
in 
the 
United 
States 
used 
a 
variant 
of 
IXESHE 
which 
has 
been 
seen 
in 
Taiwan 
since 
2009 
named 
IHEATE. 
These 
showed 
some 
differences 
from 
known 
IXESHE 
variants: 
they 
had 
a 
different 
command-and-control 
(C&C) 
communication 
model 
and 
encryption 
methods. 


One 
IHEATE 
sample 
we 
found 
contains 
the 
string 
“EMC112” 
as 
part 
of 
the 
C&C 
traffic. 
Such 
strings 
are 
frequently 
used 
to 
identify 
different 
campaigns. 
In 
this 
particular 
case, 
the 
112 
part 
of 
the 
string 
matched 
the 
malware 
sample’s 
compilation 
date 
of 
January 
12. 


The 
sample 
we 
acquired 
connects 
to 
a 
C&C 
server 
whose 
domain 
was 
first 
registered 
in 
2004, 
but 
whose 
information 
was 
modified 
in 
December 
2015. 
This 
suggests 
that 
threat 
actors 
were 
able 
to 
pose 
as 
the 
original 
registrant 
and 
modify 
the 
information 
for 
their 
own 
needs. 


Technical 
Analysis 


IXESHE 
is 
a 
well-known 
targeted 
attack 
campaign 
which 
has 
mainly 
targeted 
EastAsian 
governments, 
electronics 
manufacturers, 
and 
a 
telecommunications 
company 
in 
Germany. 
Other 
targets 
include 
G20 
government 
officials 
as 
well 
as 
the 
New 
York 
Times. 
The 
campaign 
is 
known 
for 
targeting 
users 
with 
fake 
documents 
using 
exploits 
and 
right-to-left 
override 
(RTLO) 
techniques. 


The 
particular 
sample 
we 
found 
has 
a 
SHA1 
hash 
of 
3de8ef34fb98ce5d5d0ec0f46ff92319a5976e63. 
We 
detect 
it 
as 
BKDR_IHEATE. 
Unlike 
common 
IXESHE 
variants 
which 
usually 
communicate 
with 
C&C 
servers 
via 
HTTP 
and 
a 
customized 
Base64-ecoded 
payload, 
IHEATE 
communicates 
with 
C&C 
servers 
in 
the 
TCP 
layer. 
(HEATE 
is 
a 
command 
that 
is 
sent 
by 
some 
members 
of 
this 
family 
to 
servers 
that 
acts 
as 
a 
notice 
that 
it’s 
still 
online; 
we 
derived 
the 
name 
IHEATE 
from 
this 
command 
and 
its 
ties 
to 
the 
IXESHE 
family.) 


We 
have 
learned 
from 
IXESHE 
variants 
that 
even 
though 
the 
encryption 
routine 
changed 
in 
different 
variants 
but 
the 
decrypted 
messages 
are 
almost 
similar. 


Information 
gathering 


Once 
the 
backdoor 
is 
installed, 
it 
collects 
information 
on 
the 
victim’s 
system 
and 
sends 
it 
to 
C&C 
server 
with 
the 
following 
format 
: 


|[Computername]|[Username]|[IP]|[OSversion]|[ProcessIDorTag]
Not 
all 
samples 
include 
a 
tag 
in 
their 
message. 
This 
tag 
could 
be 
a 
process 
ID, 
victim 
information, 
or 
the 
date 
when 
the 
malware 
was 
compiled. 
In 
this 
IHEATE 
sample, 
the 
tag 
is 
“EMC112”. 
The 
112 
portion 
may 
refer 
to 
when 
the 
malware 
was 
compiled, 
as 
its 
compile 
date/time 
is 
2016/01/12 
03:22:27. 


The 
threat 
actors 
behind 
IHEATE 
could 
use 
these 
tags 
to 
manage 
victims. 
The 
traffic 
back 
to 
their 
C&C 
servers 
could 
easily 
be 
sorted 
using 
these 
tags. 
Sometime 
they 
slightly 
change 
the 
feedback 
format, 
such 
as 


Removing 
spaces:“[Computer 
name]|[User 
name]|[IP]|[OS 
version]|[Tag]” 


Changing 
the 
delimiter:“* 
[Computer 
name] 
* 
[User 
name] 
* 
[IP] 
* 
[OS 
version] 
* 
[Tag]”

Encryption 


While 
IXESHE 
variants 
have 
fairly 
similar 
phone-home 
and 
backdoor 
routines, 
they 
have 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
encryption 
routines. 
IHEATE 
is 
no 
different, 
and 
has 
its 
own 
unique 
behavior. 


The 
traffic 
below 
simulates 
the 
traffic 
between 
a 
IHEATE-affected 
machine 
and 
its 
C&C 
server. 
Traffic 
from 
the 
client 
to 
the 
server 
is 
in 
red; 
traffic 
from 
the 
server 
to 
the 
client 
is 
in 
blue. 
The 
C&C 
server 
has 
sent 
a 
/DISK 
command 
to 
the 
machine. 



Figure 
1. 
Captured 
IHEATE 
network 
traffic 


The 
first 
part 
of 
the 
network 
traffic 
is 
from 
the 
client 
to 
the 
C&C 
server. 
It 
is 
as 
follows: 


1. 
The 
first 
six 
bytes 
make 
up 
the 
hardcoded 
portion 
of 
the 
encryption 
key. 
In 
this 
case, 
it 
is 
“36 
59 
6d 
56 
7c 
22”. 
We 
have 
seen 
different 
encryption 
keys 
in 
other 
IHEATE 
variants; 
in 
some 
variants 
this 
part 
is 
ten 
bytes 
long. 
2. 
The 
following 
eight 
bytes 
make 
up 
the 
randomly 
generated 
portion 
of 
the 
encryption 
key. 
Here 
it 
is 
“b0 
84 
e8 
44 
a4 
55 
85 
c7”. 
In 
some 
samples, 
this 
portion 
is 
ten 
bytes 
long. 
3. 
The 
next 
two 
bytes 
say 
how 
long 
the 
encrypted 
data 
is, 
here 
it 
is 
“61 
8a”. 
The 
contents 
are 
encrypted 
with 
RC4, 
using 
the 
randomly 
generated 
encryption 
key. 
4. 
Last 
is 
the 
data 
itself. 
This 
is 
also 
encrypted 
using 
RC4, 
with 
the 
hardcoded 
and 
randomly 
generated 
portions 
of 
the 
encryption 
key 
concatenated 
together. 
The 
second 
part 
is 
the 
response 
of 
the 
server 
to 
the 
client. 
It 
is 
described 
as 
follows: 


1. 
The 
encryption 
procedure 
is 
identical 
to 
that 
used 
by 
the 
client 
to 
talk 
to 
the 
server. 
2. 
The 
six-bit 
hardcoded 
portion 
of 
the 
encryption 
key 
must 
be 
identical 
to 
the 
one 
used 
by 
the 
client 
earlier. 
Otherwise, 
if 
the 
keys 
do 
not 
match, 
the 
connection 
is 
dropped. 
However, 
some 
newer 
IHEATE 
samples 
use 
yet 
another 
technique. 
These 
use 
asymmetric 
encryption: 


1. 
Before 
communicating 
with 
C&C 
server, 
the 
malware 
client 
generates 
a 
random 
session 
key. 
2. 
The 
client 
encrypts 
the 
session 
key 
using 
RSA-1024, 
using 
a 
public 
key 
hardcoded 
inside 
of 
malware. 
3. 
The 
client 
encrypts 
the 
data 
to 
be 
sent 
using 
a 
custom 
encryption 
routine. 
4. 
On 
top 
of 
this, 
the 
data 
sent 
to 
the 
C&C 
server 
is 
encrypted 
with 
RC4, 
using 
the 
previously 
generated 
session 
key,

C&C 
Servers 


IXESHE 
was 
known 
for 
using 
compromised 
hosts 
for 
its 
C&C 
servers, 
and 
IHEATE 
behaves 
similarly. 


The 
IHEATE 
sample 
with 
the 
“EMC112” 
identifier 
used 
the 
subdomain 
cknew[.]{abused 
domain} 
[.]com 
as 
the 
location 
of 
its 
C&C 
server. 
This 
domain 
appears 
to 
contain 
the 
personal 
blog 
of 
the 
original 
registrant, 
who 
has 
been 
using 
it 
since 
the 
domain 
was 
registered 
in 
2004. 
We 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
the 
registrant 
is 
tied 
to 
IHEATE; 
instead 
we 
believe 
that 
his 
credentials 
were 
compromised 
so 
that 
threat 
actors 
could 
set 
up 
subdomains. 
This 
site 
was 
active 
briefly 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
2015, 
but 
came 
back 
online 
at 
the 
start 
of 
2016. 


Other 
IHEATE 
samples 
showed 
interesting 
behavior 
as 
well. 
In 
one 
case, 
the 
attackers 
planted 
a 
fake 
C&C 
server 
address 
in 
the 
code: 



Figure 
4. 
Fake 
C&C 
server 
in 
code 


The 
address 
here 
is 
not 
an 
actual 
C&C 
address; 
instead 
it 
is 
used 
to 
calculate 
the 
port 
that 
the 
client 
will 
use 
(in 
this 
case, 
443: 
(24*18)+11.) 
Other 
attacks 
are 
known 
to 
have 
used 
similar 
tactics 
as 
well. 


Other 
domains 
used 
by 
IHEATE 
also 
overlapped 
with 
servers 
used 
by 
IXESHE. 
Two 
domains 
(ipv6pro[.]root[.]sx 
and 
gimeover[.]psp-moscow[.]com) 
were 
used 
by 
IHEATE 
and 
resolved 
to 
the 
IP 
address 
200[.]93[.]193[.]163.At 
approximately 
the 
same 
time, 
IXESHE 
also 
used 
the 
same 
server 
– 
except 
it 
did 
so 
by 
accessing 
the 
domain 
skype[.]silksky[.]com. 


Conclusions 


IXESHE 
and 
associated 
threats 
like 
IHEATE 
have 
not 
gone 
away, 
and 
they 
continue 
to 
evolve 
and 
change 
with 
the 
times. 
We 
will 
continue 
to 
monitor 
this 
threat 
and 
apprise 
our 
readers 
of 
any 
future 
developments.
