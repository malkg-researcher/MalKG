Most	hackerstargetindiscriminately	andinsteadofpersisting	 with	 a particular targetdraw	 theirfocus to	morevulnerabletargets.	APTsontheotherhandare not	 only	 well resourced	 and	 capable butpersistent	 in their covert	 attempts to access sensitive information, such	 asintellectualproperty,negotiation strategies or political dynamite,	 from theirchosentargets.The sophistication of APT intrusion attempts varies and	 likely	 depends on the attacker’sobjectives,	 the tools and	 techniques available tothem,	andtheanticipated	ability	oftheirtarget	both	to	detect	anddefendagainst	anattack.	Theactivity	 conducted by APTs is not	 necessarily	 sophisticated	but	 the attacker has the ability	 to	 upgrade theirsophisticationinordertogainormaintainaccessto	 computer systems of	 interest.	 The level of	covertnessemployed	maydepend	onfactorssuch	as the anticipated ability of	 the target to detect the activity, the anticipated response of the target	should	thetargetingbedetected,	thelevelofriskthehackeriswilling	to	accept,	theirtimeframetoobtainthe desired	 information and	 the effects on theirlongerterm	goals.ThetermAPTiscommonly	used	inreferencetothe cyber threat posed	 by foreign intelligenceservices, or hackers working	 on behalf	 of such	entities,	but	is	not	limited	just	to	thisandcanequallybeappliedtootherthreat	actorssuchasorganisedcrime syndicates and	 those involved	 in traditionalespionage. Even though some organised	 crimesyndicatesarevery	wellresourced	and	capable,	theyarenot	usuallyclassedasanAPTsincethey	arelesslikely	 to	 persist	 with attempted	 access to aparticular target.

In addition,zero	day	exploits	areexposed	thefirst	timethey	areusedand,ifdetected,ma belesseffectiveinfutureattacks.	 As such,	 zero day	 exploits	 are usually	 only	deployed when the hacker has determined that	other exploits (that	 take advantage of	 publicly	knownvulnerabilities) will not	 work on thetarget,	or are not expected	 to	 work within an acceptabletimeframe.Increased	useofazero	day	exploit	may	also	beobservedifthehacker believestheirexploit	hasbeendetectedorthevulnerabilityitexposeshasbecome known.

Thosethat are aware of attacks against them may	 notpublicly	disclosethefactdueto	concernsabout	theirreputation or share price. Public reports of APTattacks date back to	 at	 least	 1998,	 when thePentagon, National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration (NASA), the United States (US)Energy	 Department,	 research	 laboratories and	private universities were targeted. The past year(2010/2011)hasseenaniorganisations coming	 forwarncreaseinthenumberof	d, admitting	 they havebeen targeted. It has also seen an increase in US	SecuritiesandExchangeCommissionfilingswarning	shareholdersabouttherisksof	cyberattack.	The majority of companies that have comeforward	 and	 admitted they are among the victimshavenot	 beenforthcoming with	the details.	This ispresumably	becausethey	donot	wantto	providethehackers with	 feedback, or cause furtherembarrassment to their organisation.	 It isunfortunate that	 such potential negativeramificationsof	detailed	reporting	areoftenseento	outweigh the community	 benefitof sharing	 lessonslearned. TIMELINE OF	 SIGNIFICANT	 ATTACKS Through examination of media reports and	 publicannouncements a timeline of significant	 cyber attackslikely	attributableto	APTscan bedrawnas in Figure 1.

(Lockheed	 MartinCorporation,	 2011) (Coviello,	 Open Letter to RSA	 SecurIDCustomers,2011) 26 May 2011 – Northrop GrummanNorthrop Grumman reportedly	 shut down remoteaccess to its	 network without warning	 andconducted an organisation wide password reset,	 raising	 speculation that	 it had also	 been targeted	using	informationstolenfrom	RSA.(Kaplan,2011) May.June	2011 – International	 Monetary Fund At	 least	 one International Monetary	 Fund	 (IMF)computer was compromised in a large andsophisticated cyber attack that	 involved	 significantreconnaissance and	 utilised	 software written specifically	 to target	 the IMF.	 The compromisedcomputer was used to access internal systems and	files.	 The hackers’ access could	 have given them visibility of sensitive economic and politicalinformation.(Reddy,	Gorman,	&	Perez,	2011;Sanger &Markoff,2011)(TheGuardian,	2011) THE CURRENT CYBER THREAT ENVIRONMENT APTshavetargeted	governmentsaroundtheworld,globaloil,	energy,	and	petrochemicalcompanies,themining	 sector,	 financial institutions, military	 contractors,	 the science and	 technology	 sector,	dissidents,	 critical infrastructure and likely many additional sectors.	 They have also	 targeted	technology companies that	 could	 enable future targeting.TheOperationAuroraattacks,	theComodo	affiliated	 RA compromise and	 the RSA	 attack set aprecedentforsuch	targeting.	TheAuroraattacksappearto	havebeencarriedout	 to	 provide the attacker with	 source code andother information that	 may allow them	 to	 develop	 5zero day	 exploits and rootkits for use on theirtargets.	 The certificates generated	 in the RootAuthority	 attack would likely be of use for future state.driven attacks (despite a lone Iranian individualclaimingfullresponsibilityfortheattack,	and	 stating	 that	 there was no	 governmentinvolvement(Kobie,2011)).TheattackagainstRSA appearstohave beenconductedto	gathersensitive information to facilitate attacks againstorganisations that	 use RSA	 security	 tokens for two	 factor authentication; including	 US	 defence contractorswhoworkonclassified	projects.Based	 on the trend toward the targeting of enablingcompaniesandtheincreasingpopularityofvirtualisation, VMware Inc. and	 othervirtualisationcompanies seem likely	 to be among	 companies targeted by APTs in the future.

Thismay	include scanning	 to determine vulnerabilities,	writing	 malicious code or acquiring	 code,	 draftingsocially	engineered	emails,	determining	which	emailaccount to send socially	 engineered emails from,acquiring	 necessary	 hardware (such	 as USB flashdrives),	 determining	 what	 infrastructure to	 use to	launch	 the attack and	 for command	 and	 controlcommunications,	 registering	 for and setting	 upnecessary	 accounts (email addresses, callbackdomainsetc.)and	conducting	testing. TargetingTheattackerlaunchestheirattackand	monitorsforsigns of	 compromise or failure.	 The sender mayattempt	to	connect	remotely	toaservertoexploit	avulnerability,strategically	placeaUSBflashdriveorgiveonetoatarget,sendsocially	engineeredemailsand	if	possible,checkforbouncebacknotifications,monitor command	 and control infrastructure forbeaconing	 activity	 from	 the victim, try	 to	 connectinbound to	 the potentially	 compromised computer,orawaitfeedbackfrom	aninsider. Further AccessOnceanattackerhassuccessfully	gained	accessto	acomputer network they will usually	 try	 to	 identify	where in the network they are and move laterally	withinthenetworkto	accessdataof	interestand	toinstall additional backdoors.	 This will usuallyrequirea returnto	step 2(Preparation)and	step 3(Targeting),	 the upload	 of	 tools and malicioussoftware,	privilegeescalation,	networkenumerationand	 identification of vulnerable hosts on which toinstallbackdoors.	Itmay	alsoinvolvegaining	accessto	thedomaincontrollerto	obtainpasswordhashes,	covering	 tracksbyaltering logs,and	accessing	mailorfileserversto	enabledatagathering. Data GatheringOnce an attacker has identified information ofinteresttheywilltry	to	gather thisinformationandexfiltrate it. They may do this using a ‘smash and	grab’approach,trying	 to	exfiltratethe desired	databeforeit	isdetected,orthey	may	optfora‘low	andslow’ approach	 in which	 they	 exfiltrate the data insmallquantitiesoveralongerperiod. MaintenanceOnceanattackerhasgainedaccessto	anetworkfor information gathering purposes they will usuallyattempt	 to	 maintain their access.	 This may	 involve minimising	 the amount of malicious activity	 they	 generate on the network to	 avoid	 detection,	periodically	 communicating with backdoors on the network to	 ensure they	 are working	 as intended,	and	 making	 changes as appropriate.	 If	 automateddata gathering tools are in use,	 it may also	 involve modifying	 search terms or the exfiltration path,	volume or frequency.	 Maintenance also	 requires maintainingcallbackdomainsand	any	intermediary	 infrastructure used to	 communicate with	 the backdoors.If	accessis	 lost,	theattackermay	return to	 step 1 (Reconnaissance) orstep 2 (Preparation)inanattemptto	regainaccess. IMPROVING ORGANISATIONAL RESILIENCE ToimproveresiliencetoAPTs	organisationsshouldemploy good security	 practices and policies including	thosedescribedbelow. Information Centric	SecurityAdopt	 an information centric approach to	 securityby	applying	multiplelayersofsecurity,	affording	the most sensitive information the most protection.
