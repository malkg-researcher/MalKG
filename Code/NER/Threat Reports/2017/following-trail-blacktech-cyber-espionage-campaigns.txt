BlackTech is a cyber espionage group operating against targets in EastAsia, particularly Taiwan, and occasionally, Japan and Hong Kong. Based on the mutexes and domain names of some of their C&C servers, BlackTech’s campaigns are likely designed to steal their target’s technology. 
Following their activities and evolving tactics and techniques helped us uncover the proverbial red string of fate that connected three 


seemingly disparate campaigns: PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and of late, Waterbear. 
Over the course of their campaigns, we analyzed their modus operandi and dissected their tools of the trade—and uncovered common denominators indicating that PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and Waterbear may actually be operated by the same group. 

PLEAD 
PLEAD is an information theft campaign with a penchant for confidential documents. Active since 2012, it has so far targeted Taiwanese government agencies and private organizations. PLEAD’s toolset includes the self-named PLEAD backdoor and the DRIGO exfiltration tool. PLEAD uses spear-phishing emails to deliver and install their backdoor, either as an attachment or through links to cloud storage services. Some of the cloud storage accounts used to deliver PLEAD are also used as drop off points for exfiltrated documents stolen by DRIGO. 
PLEAD’s installers are disguised as documents using the right-to-left-override 
(RTLO) technique to obfuscate the malware’s filename. They are mostly accompanied by decoy documents to further trick users. We’ve also seen PLEAD use exploits for these vulnerabilities: 

CVE-2015-5119, patched 
byAdobe last July, 2015 

CVE-2012-0158, patched 
by Microsoft lastApril, 2012 

CVE-2014-6352, patched 
by Microsoft last October, 2014 

CVE-2017-0199, patched 
by Microsoft lastApril, 2017 

PLEAD also dabbled with a short-lived, fileless version of their malware when it obtained an exploit for a Flash vulnerability 
(CVE-2015-5119) that was leaked 
during 
the 
Hacking 
Team 
breach.

Figure 1: How PLEAD utilizes compromised routers 

PLEAD actors use a router scanner tool to scan for vulnerable routers, after which the attackers will enable the router’s VPN feature then register a machine as virtual server. This virtual server will be used either as a C&C server or an HTTP server that delivers PLEAD malware to their targets.

Delete target file PLEAD also uses the document-targeting exfiltration tool DRIGO, which mainly searches the infected machine for documents. Each copy of DRIGO contains a refresh token tied to specific Gmail accounts used by the attackers, which are in turn linked to a Google Drive account. The stolen files are uploaded to these Google Drives, where the attackers can harvest them. 

Shrouded Crossbow 
This campaign, first observed in 2010, is believed to be operated by a well-funded group given how it appeared to have purchased 
the 
source 
code 
of 
the 
BIFROST 
backdoor, which the operators enhanced and created other tools from. Shrouded Crossbow targeted privatized agencies and government contractors as well as enterprises in the consumer electronics, computer, healthcare, and financial industries. 
Shrouded Crossbow employs three BIFROST-derived backdoors: BIFROSE, KIVARS, and XBOW. Like PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow uses spear-phishing emails with backdoor-laden attachments that utilize the RTLO technique and accompanied by decoy documents. 
BIFROSE, known for evading detection by communicating with its C&C servers via Tor protocol, also has a 
version 
targeting 
UNIX-based 
operating 
systems, which are usually used in servers, workstations, and mobile devices. KIVARS has less functionality than BIFROSE, but its modular

S 
structure made it easier to maintain. KIVARS enabled attackers to download and execute files, list drives, uninstall malware service, take screenshots, activate/deactivate keylogger, show/hide active windows, and trigger mouse clicks and keyboard inputs. A64-bit 
version 
of 
KIVARS 
also 
emerged 
to keep pace with the popularity of 64-bit systems. XBOW’s capabilities are derived from BIFROSE and KIVARS; Shrouded Crossbow gets its name from its unique mutex format. 
Waterbear 
Waterbear has actually been operating for a long time. The campaign’s name is based on its malware’s capability to equip additional functions remotely. 
Waterbear similarly employs a modular approach to its malware. Aloader component executable will connect to the C&C server to download the main backdoor and load it in memory.Alater version of this malware appeared and used 
patched 
server 
applications 
as 
its 
loader 
component, while the main backdoor is either loaded from an encrypted file or downloaded from the C&C server. 
The tactic it later adopted required prior knowledge of their targets’ environment. It’s possible attackers used Waterbear as a secondary payload to help maintain presence after gaining some levels of access into the targets’ systems. 

All Roads Lead to BlackTech 
Based on the use of the same C&C servers, the campaigns’ coordinated efforts, and similarities in tools, techniques, and objectives, we can conclude that they are operated by the same group. It is not uncommon, for instance, for a group—especially a well-funded one—to split into teams and run multiple campaigns. While most of the campaigns’ attacks are conducted separately, we’ve seen apparently joint operations conducted in phases that entail the work of different teams at each point in the infection chain. 
Use of the Same C&C Servers. In several instances, we found the campaigns’ malware communicating with the same C&C servers. In targeted attacks, C&C servers are typically not shared with other groups. Here are some of the C&C servers we found that are shared by the campaigns: 
C&C Server  PLEAD  Shrouded Crossbow  Waterbear  
itaiwans[.]com  Yes  No  Yes  
microsoftmse[.]com  Yes  Yes  No  
211[.]72[.]242[.]120  Yes  Yes  No  

Table 1: C&C servers shared by PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and Waterbear 
Additionally, the IP 211[.]72 [.]242[.]120 is one of the hosts for the domain microsoftmse[.]com, which has been used by several KIVARS variants. 
Joint Operations. We also found incidents where the backdoors were used on the same targets. While it’s possible for separate groups to attack at the same time, we can construe at they are at least working together: 
PLEAD  Shrouded Crossbow  
Samples from the same group using the same filename  Loader component named after its target, i.e. {target name}.exe  Loader component named after its target, i.e. {target name}.exe or {target name}64.exe  
Backdoors using the same C&C servers  Connected to 211[.]72[.]242[.]120:53  Connected to 211[.]72[.]242[.]120:443  
Timeline indicating arrival order  Arrived two days after initial infection by SC  Established presence two years prior, but re-infected at a recent time  

Table 2: Incident where PLEAD and KIVARS attack the same target 
PLEAD  Shrouded Crossbow  Waterbear  
Samples found in same machine  vmdks.exe  cfbcjtqx.dll  tpauto.dll  
Timeline of infection  3/16/2017  2/23/2017  3/8/2017  

Table 3: Incidents where PLEAD, KIVARS, and Waterbear were used on the same target 
Similarities between tools and techniques. PLEAD and KIVARS, for instance, share the use of RTLO techniques to disguise their installers as documents. Both also use decoy documents to make the RTLO attack more convincing. Another similarity is the use of a small loader component to load encrypted backdoors into memory. 
Similar Objectives. The ulterior motive of these campaigns is to steal important documents from their victims; initial recipients of their attacks are not always their primary target. For instance, we saw several decoy documents stolen by the attackers that are then used against another target. This indicates that document theft is most likely the first phase of an attack chain against a victim with ties to the intended target. While PLEAD and KIVARS are most likely to be used in first phase attacks, Waterbear can be seen as a secondary backdoor installed after attackers have gained a certain level of privilege. 
Based on the type of documents stolen by these campaigns, we can get a clearer view of who they’re targeting and compromising, the purpose of their campaigns, and when they take place. Below are some of the categories or labels of the stolen documents: 
Address book  Internal affairs  
Budget  Laws  
Business  Livelihood economy  
Contract  Meeting  
Culture  Official letter  
Defense  Password list  
Education  Performance appraisal  
Energy  Physical culture  
Foreign affairs  Press release  
Funding application  Public security  
Human affairs  Schedule  
Enterprises Need to be Proactive  

PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and Waterbear are still actively mounting their campaigns against its targets, which is why organizations must proactively secure their perimeter. 
IT/system 
administrators 
and 
information 
security 
professionals 
can 
consider 
making 
a 
checklist 
of 
what 
to 
look 
out 
for 
in 
the 
network 
for 
any 
signs 
of 
anomalies 
and 
suspicious 
behavior 
that 
can 
indicate intrusions. 
Adopting 
best 
practices 
and 
employing 
multilayered 
security 
mechanisms 
and 
strategies 
against 
targeted 
attacks 
are 
also 
recommended. 
Network 
traffic 
analysis, 
deployment 
of 
firewalls 
and 
intrusion detection and prevention systems, network 
segmentation, and data 
categorization 
are just some of them.
