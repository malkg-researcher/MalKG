The “Tick” group has conducted cyber espionage attacks against organizations in theRepublic of Korea and Japan for several years. The group focuses on companies that haveintellectual property or sensitive information like those in the Defense and High-Techindustries. The group is known to use custom malware called Daserf, but also employsmultiple commodity and custom tools, exploit vulnerabilities, and use social engineeringtechniques. 
Regarding the command and control (C2) infrastructure, Tick previously used domainsregistered through privacy protection services to keep their anonymity, but have moved tocompromised websites in recent attacks. With multiple tools and anonymous infrastructure,they are running longstanding and persistent attack campaigns. We have observed that the adversary has repeatedly attacked a high-pro.le target in Japan using multiple malwarefamilies for the last three years. 
Tick Tools 
Symantec 
was 
.rst 
to 
publicly 
report 
on 
Tick, 
followed 
by 
LAC 
in 2016. These reportsdiscussed the group’s malware, Daserf (a.k.a Muirim or Nioupale) and some additionaldownloader programs. Though Daserf wasn’t a popular attack tool at the time of publishingthe two reports, it dates back to at least 2011. Using AutoFocus, we were able to identify the link among Daserf and two other threats, 9002 and Invader. These threats shared infrastructure between July 2012 and April 2013.

Invader (a.k.a Kickesgo) is a backdoor that injects its main code into a legitimate process,such as explorer.exe, and has following functions: 

Logs 
keystrokes and mouse movement 


Captures 
screenshots 


Opens 
cmd.exe shell 


Enumerates 
processes 


Executes 
programs 


Removes 
itself 


Enumerates 
all opening TCP and UDP ports 


9002 is the infamous RAT frequently seen in targeted attacks reported by various securityvendors, including Palo 
Alto 
Networks. Interestingly, the C2 servers linking 9002 to Daserfwere described in the report of an Adobe Flash Zero-day attack from FireEye 
in 2013. These domains were registered through the privacy protection services in 2008 and 2011.

Though we don’t know the targets of these malware samples at the time of writing this article,we suspect the same group is behind these threats for a number of reasons. The samples ofDaserf that shared infrastructure were submitted to VirusTotal only from Japan multiple timesin 2013. As noted in a later section, another Invader sample shared di.erent C2 servers with. Daserf. Symantec reported that Tick exploited additional Adobe Flash and Microsoft O.cevulnerabilities. SecureWorks 
said the adversary group is abusing a previously undisclosedvulnerability in Japanese Software Asset Management system on endpoints. Therefore, Tick or their digital quartermaster is capable of deploying new and unique exploits. 
Minzen and Nameless Backdoor 
In July 2016, we identi.ed a compromised website in Japan that was hosting a Daserf variant.The web server was also a C2 server for another threat, Minzen (a.k.a, XXMM, Wali, orShadowWali). The threat often uses compromised web servers in Japan and the Republic of Korea. 
As Kaspersky 
and Cybereason 
recently posted, Minzen is a modular malware that has both32-bit and 64-bit components in its resource section or con.guration data in its body. One of. the Minzen samples (SHA256:9374040a9e2f47f7037edaac19f21.1ef6a999.98c306504f89a37196074a2) found in theRepublic of Korea in December 2016 installs simple backdoor module as a .nal payload on acompromised computer. It opens a TCP port and receives commands from a remote attacker.According to the debug path in the body, the author of the tool called it “NamelessHdoor,” and its internal version is identi.ed as “V1.5.”. 

Figure 2 Debug path left in the backdoor module in Minzen 
The payload is based on “Nameless Backdoor” which has been publicly available for more than ten years. The oldest code we could identify was hosted on a famous Chinese sourcecode sharing site since 2005. The author of the NamelessHdoor appears to have createdadditional versions of the Nameless Backdoor by removing unnecessary functions, andadded open-source DLL injection code from Re.ectiveDLLLoader. 

Figure 3 Nameless Backdoor posted on Chinese Source File Sharing Site 
There is minimal public information regarding the Nameless Backdoor, except for theinteresting report from Cyphort 
in 2015. The researcher of the company analyzed multiplethreats, including Invader, Nioupale(Daserf) and Hdoor found in an attack against an Asian.nancial institution. We examined the sample described in the report as Hdoor and found it’sa previous version of the NamelessHdoor we discovered in the Minzen sample, but withoutsupport for DLL injection.

Shared Infrastructure and Cipher Code with Custom Gh0st 
Other interesting samples in the report are dllhost.exe and Shell64.dll. We don’t have the same .les but found possible variants close to their description in the article. These include. the following: 

Executable 
.les that connect to the same remote server, blog.soft.x.co[.]kr:80,. download a DLL .le and execute the ‘lowmain’ export function.. 


DLL 
.les have ‘lowmain’ and ‘main’ exports.. 


It turned out that the DLL .les we found are a custom variant of Gh0st RAT, and the EXE .les. download the RAT. Since the source code is publicly available, Gh0st RAT has been used by multiple actors for years. 
The domain, soft.x.co[.]kr was registered in 2014. One of subdomains, news.soft.x.co[.]kr. was the C2 server of Daserf (SHA256:9c7a34390e92d4551c26a3feb5b181757b3309995acd1f92e0f63f888aa89423). Another subdomain, bbs.soft.x.co[.]kr was hosted on same IP address as bbs.gokickes[.]com, whichwas reported as the C2 server of Invader by Cyphort. We also identi.ed www.gokickes[.]com. was the C2 of another Invader variant (SHA256:57e1d3122e6dc88d9eb2989f081de88a0e6864e767281d509.58834928895fb).. 
In addition to the infrastructure, the attacker also shared code. The Gh0st downloaders employ simple substitution ciphers for hiding strings. 

Figure 5 Decryption code in Gh0st Downloader 
The cipher converts one character to another based on a substitution table, which can beseen below. As an example, the character ‘K’ in plain text is changed to ‘5’ in cipher text, ‘h’ is converted to ‘j’ and so on. The string ‘connect’ was encoded to ‘zF((0za’ using this table.

Table 1 Substitution Table used in Gh0st Downloader 
The following Python script can decipher the encoded string. 

The exact same table for simple substitution cipher is used in a variant of Daserf (SHA256:01d681c51ad0c7c3d4b320973c61c28a353624ac665fd390553b364d17911f46). We also found a very similar table in other Tick tools. Since the strings are unique to these threats, we believe a developer linked to the group built these tools. Because of the shared domains and code, we believe the incident reported by Cyphort have ties to Tick. The following tables were identi.ed for their associated malware samples:. 
Minzen (SHA256:26727d139b593486237b975e7bdf93a8148c52d5fb48d5fe540a634a16a6ba82):

Datper (SHA256:7d70d659c421b50604ce3e0a1bf423ab7e54b9df361360933bac3bb852a31849):

Spearphishing Email with Patched File Encryption Program 
We also identi.ed another malware family, HomamDownloader, sharing some servers withDaserf. An overview of the connections among these threats is discussed in below. 

Figure 6 Links among threats and servers 
HomamDownloader is a small downloader program with minimal interesting characteristicsfrom a technical point of view. HomamDownloader was discovered to be delivered by Tick via a spearphishing email. The adversary crafted credible email and attachment afterunderstanding the targets and their behavior. 
The email below was sent from a personal email account with a subject line of “New Year Wishes on January 1st”. The message asked the recipient to rename the attachment extension from “._X_” to “.exe” and opening it with the password speci.ed in the email toview the Happy New Year eCard in the correct and polite language. 

Figure 7 Spearphishing Email with HomamDownloader 
The image above is translated to the following in English: 
Dear XXXX, 
Heartfelt Greetings for the New Year.Thank you very much for your support over the past year.I will greatly appreciate your further guidance and encouragement. 
Would you please change the .le extension of the attachment from “._X_” to “.exe” and open. it? Password is “nengajyo”. 
For those who are not familiar with Japanese companies, the email must look suspicious,especially given that the executable .le attachment has the incorrect .le extension. However,. this may look legitimate in some cases. Many Japanese companies introduced a .leencryption system for secure data exchange over email. The system encrypts documentswith a user-speci.ed password and often creates a self-extracting (SFX) .le for ease ofdecrypting the .le to recipients. When sending the SFX .le with a password by email, senders. usually rename the .le extension from .exe to something else to avoid blocking or detectingthe attachment by an email gateway or security product. The adversary may know Japaneseenterprise users exchange these emails in such a way and crafts the spearphishing email inthe same manner. 
In addition to the social engineering email technique, the attacker also employs a trick to theattachment. The actor embedded malicious code to a resource section of the legitimate SFX.le created by a .le encryption tool, and modi.ed the entry point of the program for jumpingto the malicious code soon after the SFX program starts. The malicious code dropsHomamDownloader, then jumps back to the regular .ow in the CODE section, which in turnasks the user the password and decrypts the .le. Therefore, once a user executes the. attachment and sees the password dialog on SFX, the downloader dropped by the maliciouscode starts working even if the user chooses the Cancel on the password window. Should the user become aware of the infection later, it may be di.cult to .nd the cause due to the factthat the original embedded .le contained within the SFX is benign..

Conclusion 
Tick was spotted last year, but they are actively and silently attacking various organizations inSouth Korea and Japan for a number of years. While some of the group’s tools, tactics, andprocedures (TTPs) have been covered within this article, it is likely there is much that stillremains uncovered.
