1. Summary information 
The Gaza cybergang is an Arabic-language, politically-motivated cybercriminal group, operating since 2012 and actively targeting the MENA (Middle East North Africa) region. The Gaza cybergang’s attacks have never slowed down and its typical targets include government entities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists, politicians, and diplomats. 
One of the interesting new facts, uncovered in mid-2017, is its discovery inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, in.ltrating systems and pilfering data, apparently for more than a year. 
Another interesting .nding is the use of the recently discovered CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability, and Microsoft Access .les into which the download scripts were embedded to reduce the likelihood of their detection. Traces of mobile malware that started to appear from late April 2017, are also being investigated. 
Recent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature; the attackers do not appear to be choosing targets selectively, but rather seeking di.erent kinds of MENA intelligence. 
Some of the interesting new updates about the Gaza cybergang: 

Gaza cybergang attackers have continued their interest in 
government entities in MENA 

New 
targets identi.ed include oil and gas in MENA 


New 
tools and techniques include

of the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability 


Usage 
of macros inside Microsoft Access .les, enabling lower detection rates

2. Technical details 
Previously, Gaza cybergang attacks were surprisingly successful in using simple and common tools to achieve their goals. They relied on a variety of Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to perform their activities, including Downeks, Qasar, Cobaltstrike… 
As recently as June 2017, however, the attackers started using the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability which enables direct code execution from a Microsoft o.ce document on non-patched victim systems (Cobaltstrike payload in this case). Another .nding is a possible Android Trojan that the attackers positioned on one of their command servers in April 2017. 
In most cases, malware is sent by email as a compressed attachment or download links. Starting from March 2017, we have observed downloaders or Microsoft o.ce documents with embedded macros being sent to victims. When opened, the downloader would contact a URL or IP address to retrieve the actual payload. Once successfully executed, the malware grants full access to the attackers, providing them with the ability to collect .les, keystrokes and screenshots from victims’ devices. If the initial downloaded malware was detected by the victim, the downloader would attempt to retrieve other malware .les to the victim’s device, in the hope that one of those .les would work. 
The full list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) can be found in Appendix 
I. The list of the most interesting lure content, malware .les and related droppers, and command servers can be found in Appendix II.

4. New .ndings 
Gaza Cybergang attackers have been continuously evolving their skills on di.erent levels, using new methods and techniques to deliver malware, in 
addition to adapting social engineering decoys to regional political and humanitarian incidents. 
In mid-2017, the attackers were discovered inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, in.ltrating systems and pilfering data, apparently for more than a year. The malware .les that were found had been 
reported 
previously: 
https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang­
wheres-your-ir-team/72283/ 

While traces of Android mobile malware have been spotted, attackers have continuously used the Downeks downloader and the Quasar or Cobaltstrike RATs to target Windows devices, enabling them to obtain remote access spying and data ex.ltration abilities. This is now achieved more e.ciently using the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability which enables direct code execution abilities from a Microsoft o.ce document on non-patched victim Windows systems. The use of Microsoft Access database .les has also enabled the attackers to maintain low levels of detection, as it’s not an uncommon method to deliver malware. 
These developments have helped the attackers continue their operations, targeting a variety of victims and organizations, sometimes even bypassing defences and persisting for prolonged periods. 
4.1. The extended use of humanitarian and political causes in social engineering attacks 
Attackers have continuously targeted victims and organizations in government entities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists, politicians, and diplomats. 
The Gaza cybergang relies increasingly on advanced and up-to-date social engineering techniques with political and humanitarian aspects that directly re.ect regional incidents. Here is a short list of incidents that were each used multiple times: 

Palestinian Government not paying salaries to Gaza employees 

Palestinian 
prisoners’ hunger strike in Israeli jails 


The 
political crisis in Qatar 


Recent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature, the attackers do not appear to be choosing targets selectively, but rather seeking any type of intelligence.

4.2. The use of Microsoft Access .les with macros 
Microsoft Access .les with macro is another new development by the attacker group. MS Access database-embedded macros are proving to have very low detection rates.

The attacks are a typical exploitation of CVE-2017-0199, starting with an email that distributes a malicious RTF document. The vulnerability is in the code that handles Ole2Link embedded objects, which allows Microsoft O.ce Word to run remote .les, downloaded in this case from 138.68.242[.]68. The downloaded payload is Cobaltstrike, which then connects to lol.mynetav[.]org to receive commands from the attackers. Additional details on the Gaza cybergang’s use of CVE 2017-0199 with Cobaltstrike, can be found here: 
http://bobao.360.cn/learning/detail/4193.html 


4.4. Possible Android mobile malware 
Traces of APK .les have been seen on one of the attackers’ command centers, starting from 23-04-2017. 
URL: http://alasra-paper.duckdns[.]org/send/%D9%88%ket-Edition­1.04_ApkHouse[.]com/Dont-Starve-Pocket-Edition­1.04_ApkHouse[.]com.apk 
The .le name (Dont-Starve-Pocket-Edition-1.04_ApkHouse[.]com.apk), is an Android application .le hiding as a popular game. We believe the android Trojan could be related to a previously investigated Android Trojan

5. Conclusion 
The Gaza Cybergang has demonstrated a large number of attacks and advanced social engineering, in addition to active development of attacks, infrastructure and the utilization of new methods and techniques. Attackers are actively improving their toolkit in an e.ort to minimize their exposure to security products and services. Kaspersky Lab expects these types of attacks to intensify in the near term, both in terms of quality and quantity. 
In order to protect your company from malware, Kaspersky Lab researchers recommend implementing the following measures: 

Educate sta. to be able to distinguish spear-phishing emails or a 
phishing link from legitimate emails and links 

Use 
proven corporate grade security solution in combination with anti-targeted attacks solutions capable of catching attacks by analyzing network anomalies 


Provide 
security sta. with access to the latest threat intelligence data, which will arm them with helpful tools for targeted attacks prevention and discovery, such as indicators of compromise and YARA rules 


Make 
sure enterprise grade patch management processes are well established and executed.
