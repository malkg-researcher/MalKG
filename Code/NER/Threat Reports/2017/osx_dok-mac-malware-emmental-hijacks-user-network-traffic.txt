The 
OSX_DOK 
malware 
(Detected 
by 
Trend 
Micro 
as 
OSX_DOK. 
C) 
showcases 
sophisticated 
features 
such 
as 
certificate 
abuse 
and 
security 
software 
evasion 
that 
affects 
machines 
usingApple’s 
OSX 
operating 
system. 
This 
malware, 
which 
specifically 
targets 
Swiss 
banking 
users, 
uses 
a 
phishing 
campaign 
to 
drop 
its 
payload, 
which 
eventually 
results 
in 
the 
hijacking 
of 
a 
user’s 
network 
traffic 
using 
a 
Man-in-the-Middle 
(MitM) 
attack. 
OSX_DOK.C 
seems 
to 
be 
another 
version 
of 
WERDLOD 
(Detected 
by 
Trend 
Micro 
as 
TROJ_WERDLOD), 
which 
is 
a 
malware 
that 
was 
used 
during 
the 
Operation 
Emmental 
campaigns—an 
interesting 
development 
that 
we 
will 
tackle 
further 
in 
this 
blog 
post. 
Arrival Method and Infection Flow 


Figure 1: OSX_DOK.C infection routine for Mac systems 
OSX_DOK.C first arrives via a phishing email that contains certain files labeled as either .zip or .docx files. The sample we analyzed was a purported message from a police inspector in Zurich allegedly claiming to unsuccessfully contact the recipient. The email also comes with two files attached claiming to contain questions for the user: one is a .zip file, which is a fake OSX app, while the other is a .docx file used to target Windows operating systems using WERDLOD. Both of these samples work as Banking Trojans and provide similar functionalities. 
Some examples of the files used in the email attachment include the following: 

Zahlungsinformationen 01.06.2017.zip 

Zahlungsinformationen digitec.zip 

zip 

Dokument 09.06.2017.zip 

Dokument 09.06.2017.docx 

docx 

docx 

06.2017.docx Once the docx file included in the phishing email is clicked, a warning window will pop up:

Figure 4: Fake OSX update screen 
The malware will begin to download other utilities. It relies on Homebrew, an open source software package manager to install Golang and Tor. 
The malware will then install fake certificates in the system to perform a MitM attack without notifying the user. 
The structure of the fakeApp Store matches the application 
bundle 
structure 
and provides both English and German interfaces. The main executable is Dokument.app/Contents/MacOS/AppStore. 
The archive in Mac OSX looks like this:

Mac OSX will run the application if it passes certificates. In this case, the malware is signed off by a “developer”, which may actually be a dummy account or that of a compromised user. In addition, the time stamp on the CAis new, which might mean that it was obtained specifically for this attack. 
The fake certificate imitates the COMODO root certificate. Take note that the fake certificate does not contain a COMODO CertificateAuthority seal that certifies its validity, as seen in the comparison below: 

Figure 6: Comparison of a Fake COMODO (left) root certificate vs a genuine COMODO certificate (right) 
We noticed that this malware will not work for Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome since these two browsers have their own root certificates. Of all the major browsers, only Safari uses the system’s certificates. 
We observed the attacker targeting both Windows and Mac OSX in the same spam mail on June 9, 2017. There is a file shortcut embedded in the malicious .docx file—one that will download an executable file from Dropbox—that executes once clicked by the user. The functionalities are similar to the malicious app provided, which includes installing tor and proxy. 
We have already notified Dropbox about the use of its service for this malware. Dropbox has already taken down the links. 
The malware will install two proxies running on local host port 5555 and 5588. All of the traffic will be hijacked into the first proxy (port 5555) with the victim’s external IP address as parameter. 

Figure 7: Installing proxies on local host port 5555 
The first (port 5555) proxy first finds the IP parameter. If it is not in Switzerland, the traffic will proceed as normal. If it detects an IP located in Switzerland, the malware will run an obfuscated JavaScript code and find its visiting domain. If the domain is in the target, the malware will perform a MitM attack and redirect the traffic to the second proxy (port 5588), which routes the traffic to the Tor network. The purpose of these steps is to target users in Switzerland and hijack their traffic 
After deobfuscating the malware, we found the target domains: 

Figure 8: Hardcoded list of target banking websites in Switzerland 
The target domain’s visitors will be redirected into an e-banking login page that looks and acts normally, but is located on dark web sites. 
However, once the victim enters an account and password. Awindow will pop out. 

Figure 9: Hijacking connection to EKR bank 
The pop-out window is just smoke and mirrors, where nothing actually happens once the countdown timer reaches zero. 
We analyzed the webpage and found attackers injecting a script into the webpage. Once the user enters an account and password, it will initiate POST usingAJAX. The POST message is sent to the same site as the fake login page—which an attacker can control inside the Tor network. 

We decoded the data section and found not only the account and password, but that it also fingerprinted the user’s browser and system information. 
While Operation Emmental was able to bypass two-way authentication by tricking its victims into installing a fake app, we have not observed OSX_DOK.C doing this. However, since they can inject code into the webpage, it means they have the ability to do this as well. 
Performing static analysis on OSX_DOK.C 
We performed static analysis on the sample and found it packed by Ultimate Packer for Executables (UPX), an open source executable packer that can often be abused by malware. We successfully unpacked the initial sample we found dropped by the UPX unpacker. 
The malware is not obfuscated so we easily found interesting strings here. We can see that the malware relies on bash shell for most of its setup. 

We were not able to unpack the sample discovered after June 9, 2017. The UPX gave a warning message about memory buffer overflow. The malware author seemingly made unpacking the malware more difficult to slow down or even evade the antivirus engine’s scanning process. The packer is the same but the malware tries to exploit the undiscovered bug in the UPX library that causes unpack failure. We have reported the issues to the UPX team, and they have already fixed it. 
The impacted versions of the UPX 
library 
are 3.94, 3.93, and 3.92. This technique enables the malware to efficiently run while evading unpacking techniques from theAntiVirus-integrated UPX library. 

Connecting OSX_DOK.C with WERDLOD 
As mentioned earlier, we believe that OSX_DOK.C might be the MAC OSX version of WERDLOD, an online banking malware that used the same techniques as Operation Emmental. Other research have also 
connected 
the 
OSX 
malware 
and 
Retefe 
(the 
external 
term 
used 
for 
WERDLOD) 
via 
similarities 
in 
their 
behavior. 

While OSX_DOK.C is designed for MAC OSX, which is a Unix-like system, WERDLOD is designed for Windows. But in terms of features and behaviors, these two malware are very similar. Here is a list of their similarities. 

Both malware kill all current browsers before installing fake certificates: 
Both WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C are designed to kill the browser process before installing fake certificates. While WERDLOD kills processes for Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome, OSX_DOK.C does the same on Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. 

Both malware share the same proxy settings and script: 
While WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C use different codes (since they target different operating systems), they have similar proxy settings and script formats. In particular, WERDLOD uses scripts running on hxxp://127.0.0.1:555/#{random_string}.js?ip=#{my_ip} as proxy: 

Comparing it to OSX_DOK.C, we can see that it uses the same script format: 


Both malware have similar targets: 
Both WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C targeted financial institutions, with a particular focus on banks in Switzerland. Further analysis of both malware revealed that their main targets are very similar, as seen in the screenshot below. While it’s possible that this is a coincidence, the rest of the evidence makes it unlikely for these two malware to target the same organizations by chance. 

Given the connection between WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C, it is reasonable to assume that the latter is also a part of the Operational Emmental campaign. To further illustrate, here is a timeline of Operation Emmental and its potential relationship to OSX_DOK.C:
