RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names . New COVID domain registrations , per day Total new COVID domain names , to date February February March March 0 12 , 5 K 25 K 37 , 5 K 50 K 0 1 K 2 K 3 K 4 K WHO declare COVID 19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern Lockdowns begin in North America Fig . 17 .

TLS certificate registrations that referred to the pandemic spiked at about the same time as the domain registrations . Source : SophosLabs . We saw an average of over 200 certificate requests for COVID 19 domains per day in March , and the rate continued to climb in the subsequent months . By June , the average reached 625 a day . In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository . The attacker discovered , then used those credentials to attack , using the native cloud providers APIs spinning up hundreds of VM instances to mine Bitcoin . At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on .

Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository .

At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","Trojans","MALWARE","Google","ORG","Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too .

Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","Trojans","MALWARE","virtual_private_network","HOST","Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request .

Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners .

More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names .

In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository . The attacker discovered , then used those credentials to attack , using the native cloud providers APIs spinning up hundreds of VM instances to mine Bitcoin . At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way . Android Joker malware growing in volume Android users find themselves in the middle of an arms race between Google ( which owns the Android platform and its primary Google Play Store ) and malware creators who want their malware listed for download on the Google Play Store .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","malware","MALWARE","network_attach_storage","HOST","Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository .

At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","Trojans","MALWARE","hard_drive","HOST","Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names .

In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository .

At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","Trojans","MALWARE","malware","MALWARE","Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day .

The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage .

The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","rat","MALWARE","network_attach_storage","HOST","Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations . RDP login attempts per honeypot London 508 , 320 Ohio 536 , 772 Ireland 590 , 441 Frankfurt 521 , 778 California 457 , 725 Mumbai 266 , 448 Paris 466 , 716 Singapore 236 , 490 So Paulo 410 , 143 Sydney 303 , 680 Fig . 7 . We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense .

This table illustrates how many new , unique samples we encountered over a seven month period that we later classified to one of the 18 most common RAT families , broken out by the family names . * Partial month data . Source : SophosLabs . Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms . COVID 19 and Coronavirus Email Scams on the Rise 3 % 2 . 68 % 2 . 5 % % of total spam volume 2 . 25 % 1 . 99 % 1 . 74 % 1 . 77 % 1 . 42 % 1 . 5 % 1 . 33 % 1 . 31 % 1 . 19 % 1 . 36 % 1 . 08 % 1 . 01 % 0 . 75 % 0 . 72 % 0 . 59 % 0 . 58 % 0 % 19 20 16 17 15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 21 06 18 March Fig . 13 . Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names . New COVID domain registrations , per day Total new COVID domain names , to date February February March March 0 12 , 5 K 25 K 37 , 5 K 50 K 0 1 K 2 K 3 K 4 K WHO declare COVID 19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern Lockdowns begin in North America Fig . 17 .

TLS certificate registrations that referred to the pandemic spiked at about the same time as the domain registrations . Source : SophosLabs . We saw an average of over 200 certificate requests for COVID 19 domains per day in March , and the rate continued to climb in the subsequent months . By June , the average reached 625 a day . In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups . Fig . 19 . Even infamous pill mill scammers could nt resist getting in on whatever miracle cure came across Twitter , and even posted tweets in the ads . Source : SophosLabs . A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","malware","MALWARE","Google","ORG","There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations . RDP login attempts per honeypot London 508 , 320 Ohio 536 , 772 Ireland 590 , 441 Frankfurt 521 , 778 California 457 , 725 Mumbai 266 , 448 Paris 466 , 716 Singapore 236 , 490 So Paulo 410 , 143 Sydney 303 , 680 Fig . 7 . We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done .

The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too .

Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names .

In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day .

How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges .

Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs .

In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups . Fig . 19 . Even infamous pill mill scammers could nt resist getting in on whatever miracle cure came across Twitter , and even posted tweets in the ads . Source : SophosLabs . A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","malware","MALWARE","Google","ORG","Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","Trojans","MALWARE","Google","ORG","Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations . RDP login attempts per honeypot London 508 , 320 Ohio 536 , 772 Ireland 590 , 441 Frankfurt 521 , 778 California 457 , 725 Mumbai 266 , 448 Paris 466 , 716 Singapore 236 , 490 So Paulo 410 , 143 Sydney 303 , 680 Fig . 7 . We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs .

The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target .

Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names .

We saw an average of over 200 certificate requests for COVID 19 domains per day in March , and the rate continued to climb in the subsequent months . By June , the average reached 625 a day . In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository . The attacker discovered , then used those credentials to attack , using the native cloud providers APIs spinning up hundreds of VM instances to mine Bitcoin . At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository .

At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","Trojans","MALWARE","Google","ORG","Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","rat","MALWARE","malware","MALWARE","Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations . RDP login attempts per honeypot London 508 , 320 Ohio 536 , 772 Ireland 590 , 441 Frankfurt 521 , 778 California 457 , 725 Mumbai 266 , 448 Paris 466 , 716 Singapore 236 , 490 So Paulo 410 , 143 Sydney 303 , 680 Fig . 7 . We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request .

The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam .

BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target .

Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names .

In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository . The attacker discovered , then used those credentials to attack , using the native cloud providers APIs spinning up hundreds of VM instances to mine Bitcoin . At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way . Android Joker malware growing in volume Android users find themselves in the middle of an arms race between Google ( which owns the Android platform and its primary Google Play Store ) and malware creators who want their malware listed for download on the Google Play Store . Google has spent years on a system designed to inspect source code of Android apps submitted for inclusion in the Google Play Store , in search of chunks of code that indicate a malicious intent or an undesirable outcome for an Android user .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","malware","MALWARE","Google_Play","ORG","Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location .

Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","malware","MALWARE","malware","MALWARE","Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations . RDP login attempts per honeypot London 508 , 320 Ohio 536 , 772 Ireland 590 , 441 Frankfurt 521 , 778 California 457 , 725 Mumbai 266 , 448 Paris 466 , 716 Singapore 236 , 490 So Paulo 410 , 143 Sydney 303 , 680 Fig . 7 . We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense .

But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way .

This table illustrates how many new , unique samples we encountered over a seven month period that we later classified to one of the 18 most common RAT families , broken out by the family names . * Partial month data . Source : SophosLabs . Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names .

In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups . Fig . 19 . Even infamous pill mill scammers could nt resist getting in on whatever miracle cure came across Twitter , and even posted tweets in the ads . Source : SophosLabs . A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too .

Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources .

Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too .

In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way .

This table illustrates how many new , unique samples we encountered over a seven month period that we later classified to one of the 18 most common RAT families , broken out by the family names . * Partial month data . Source : SophosLabs . Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations . RDP login attempts per honeypot London 508 , 320 Ohio 536 , 772 Ireland 590 , 441 Frankfurt 521 , 778 California 457 , 725 Mumbai 266 , 448 Paris 466 , 716 Singapore 236 , 490 So Paulo 410 , 143 Sydney 303 , 680 Fig . 7 . We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months .

In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way .

This table illustrates how many new , unique samples we encountered over a seven month period that we later classified to one of the 18 most common RAT families , broken out by the family names . * Partial month data . Source : SophosLabs . Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names .

TLS certificate registrations that referred to the pandemic spiked at about the same time as the domain registrations . Source : SophosLabs . We saw an average of over 200 certificate requests for COVID 19 domains per day in March , and the rate continued to climb in the subsequent months . By June , the average reached 625 a day . In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups . Fig . 19 . Even infamous pill mill scammers could nt resist getting in on whatever miracle cure came across Twitter , and even posted tweets in the ads . Source : SophosLabs . A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . "

Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake .

Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","Trojans","MALWARE","Google_Play","ORG","Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations . RDP login attempts per honeypot London 508 , 320 Ohio 536 , 772 Ireland 590 , 441 Frankfurt 521 , 778 California 457 , 725 Mumbai 266 , 448 Paris 466 , 716 Singapore 236 , 490 So Paulo 410 , 143 Sydney 303 , 680 Fig . 7 . We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done .

Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection .

Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms . COVID 19 and Coronavirus Email Scams on the Rise 3 % 2 . 68 % 2 . 5 % % of total spam volume 2 . 25 % 1 . 99 % 1 . 74 % 1 . 77 % 1 . 42 % 1 . 5 % 1 . 33 % 1 . 31 % 1 . 19 % 1 . 36 % 1 . 08 % 1 . 01 % 0 . 75 % 0 . 72 % 0 . 59 % 0 . 58 % 0 % 19 20 16 17 15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 21 06 18 March Fig . 13 . Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names .

We saw an average of over 200 certificate requests for COVID 19 domains per day in March , and the rate continued to climb in the subsequent months . By June , the average reached 625 a day . In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups . Fig . 19 . Even infamous pill mill scammers could nt resist getting in on whatever miracle cure came across Twitter , and even posted tweets in the ads . Source : SophosLabs . A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request .

For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document .

In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names .

In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository .

At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","Trojans","MALWARE","Google_Play","ORG","Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location .

Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer .

Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too .

Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","Trojans","MALWARE","malware","MALWARE","Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations . RDP login attempts per honeypot London 508 , 320 Ohio 536 , 772 Ireland 590 , 441 Frankfurt 521 , 778 California 457 , 725 Mumbai 266 , 448 Paris 466 , 716 Singapore 236 , 490 So Paulo 410 , 143 Sydney 303 , 680 Fig . 7 . We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months .

But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave .

Android Joker malware growing in volume Android users find themselves in the middle of an arms race between Google ( which owns the Android platform and its primary Google Play Store ) and malware creators who want their malware listed for download on the Google Play Store . Google has spent years on a system designed to inspect source code of Android apps submitted for inclusion in the Google Play Store , in search of chunks of code that indicate a malicious intent or an undesirable outcome for an Android user . Malware app developers have had to work hard to evade the Google Play Store code checks . Joker , aka Bread , is a premium SMS and billing fraud app , one of the more successful examples of a malware family that has evolved to evade these code checks . "
"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","Trojans","MALWARE","malware","MALWARE","Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Remote Desktop brute force attempts target the most common Windows usernames , including the default administrator account . Source : SophosLabs . Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms . COVID 19 and Coronavirus Email Scams on the Rise 3 % 2 . 68 % 2 . 5 % % of total spam volume 2 . 25 % 1 . 99 % 1 . 74 % 1 . 77 % 1 . 42 % 1 . 5 % 1 . 33 % 1 . 31 % 1 . 19 % 1 . 36 % 1 . 08 % 1 . 01 % 0 . 75 % 0 . 72 % 0 . 59 % 0 . 58 % 0 % 19 20 16 17 15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 21 06 18 March Fig . 13 . Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names .

We saw an average of over 200 certificate requests for COVID 19 domains per day in March , and the rate continued to climb in the subsequent months . By June , the average reached 625 a day . In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups . Fig . 19 . Even infamous pill mill scammers could nt resist getting in on whatever miracle cure came across Twitter , and even posted tweets in the ads . Source : SophosLabs . A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation .

In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam .

BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it .

Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository . The attacker discovered , then used those credentials to attack , using the native cloud providers APIs spinning up hundreds of VM instances to mine Bitcoin . At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","malware","MALWARE","network_attach_storage","HOST","The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","Trojans","MALWARE","Google","ORG","Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations . RDP login attempts per honeypot London 508 , 320 Ohio 536 , 772 Ireland 590 , 441 Frankfurt 521 , 778 California 457 , 725 Mumbai 266 , 448 Paris 466 , 716 Singapore 236 , 490 So Paulo 410 , 143 Sydney 303 , 680 Fig . 7 . We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs .

Source : SophosLabs . Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names . New COVID domain registrations , per day Total new COVID domain names , to date February February March March 0 12 , 5 K 25 K 37 , 5 K 50 K 0 1 K 2 K 3 K 4 K WHO declare COVID 19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern Lockdowns begin in North America Fig . 17 .

TLS certificate registrations that referred to the pandemic spiked at about the same time as the domain registrations . Source : SophosLabs . We saw an average of over 200 certificate requests for COVID 19 domains per day in March , and the rate continued to climb in the subsequent months . By June , the average reached 625 a day . In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository . The attacker discovered , then used those credentials to attack , using the native cloud providers APIs spinning up hundreds of VM instances to mine Bitcoin . At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way . Android Joker malware growing in volume Android users find themselves in the middle of an arms race between Google ( which owns the Android platform and its primary Google Play Store ) and malware creators who want their malware listed for download on the Google Play Store . Google has spent years on a system designed to inspect source code of Android apps submitted for inclusion in the Google Play Store , in search of chunks of code that indicate a malicious intent or an undesirable outcome for an Android user . Malware app developers have had to work hard to evade the Google Play Store code checks . "

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository .

At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way .

Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations . RDP login attempts per honeypot London 508 , 320 Ohio 536 , 772 Ireland 590 , 441 Frankfurt 521 , 778 California 457 , 725 Mumbai 266 , 448 Paris 466 , 716 Singapore 236 , 490 So Paulo 410 , 143 Sydney 303 , 680 Fig . 7 . We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","malware","MALWARE","malware","MALWARE","We run all newly discovered remote access trojan ( RAT ) malware samples through our internal sandbox system . This table illustrates how many new , unique samples we encountered over a seven month period that we later classified to one of the 18 most common RAT families , broken out by the family names . * Partial month data . Source : SophosLabs . Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations . RDP login attempts per honeypot London 508 , 320 Ohio 536 , 772 Ireland 590 , 441 Frankfurt 521 , 778 California 457 , 725 Mumbai 266 , 448 Paris 466 , 716 Singapore 236 , 490 So Paulo 410 , 143 Sydney 303 , 680 Fig . 7 . We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","malware","MALWARE","Google","ORG","There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names . New COVID domain registrations , per day Total new COVID domain names , to date February February March March 0 12 , 5 K 25 K 37 , 5 K 50 K 0 1 K 2 K 3 K 4 K WHO declare COVID 19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern Lockdowns begin in North America Fig . 17 .

We saw an average of over 200 certificate requests for COVID 19 domains per day in March , and the rate continued to climb in the subsequent months . By June , the average reached 625 a day . In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups . Fig . 19 . Even infamous pill mill scammers could nt resist getting in on whatever miracle cure came across Twitter , and even posted tweets in the ads . Source : SophosLabs . A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository . The attacker discovered , then used those credentials to attack , using the native cloud providers APIs spinning up hundreds of VM instances to mine Bitcoin . At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way . Android Joker malware growing in volume Android users find themselves in the middle of an arms race between Google ( which owns the Android platform and its primary Google Play Store ) and malware creators who want their malware listed for download on the Google Play Store . Google has spent years on a system designed to inspect source code of Android apps submitted for inclusion in the Google Play Store , in search of chunks of code that indicate a malicious intent or an undesirable outcome for an Android user .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","rat","MALWARE","Google_Play","ORG","Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network .

Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners .

Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","malware","MALWARE","Google","ORG","Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch .

Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too .

Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations . RDP login attempts per honeypot London 508 , 320 Ohio 536 , 772 Ireland 590 , 441 Frankfurt 521 , 778 California 457 , 725 Mumbai 266 , 448 Paris 466 , 716 Singapore 236 , 490 So Paulo 410 , 143 Sydney 303 , 680 Fig . 7 . We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names .

We saw an average of over 200 certificate requests for COVID 19 domains per day in March , and the rate continued to climb in the subsequent months . By June , the average reached 625 a day . In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too .

In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way .

This African proverb could nt ring truer for the cybersecurity industry . By working collectively , with a strong sense of teamwork , we can achieve far more than fighting cybercrime as individual vendors . But , only by improving our approach and sharing threat intelligence more comprehensively , and by expanding the pool of participants who contribute to ( and benefit from ) this sharing and collaboration , will cybersecurity vendors continue to drive up costs for attackers , and make lasting , impactful change . In the spirit of that approach to working together , in 2017 Sophos joined the Cyber Threat Alliance , an organization dedicated to breaking down the barriers that , for years , stymied any chance for competitors in the information security industry to collaborate with one another . The CTA has succeeded far beyond its initial mandate to serve as a repository of shared threat intelligence and a place to resolve differences , and has become a sort of UN to the cybersecurity industry . Through our partnership with the CTA , Sophos can better protect our customers , thanks to the early warnings and data exchange between vendors , made possible by the alliance . Sophos also shares the burden of protecting the other vendors customers by contributing our own threat intel . In March 2020 , as lockdowns to contain the spread of COVID 19 were implemented rapidly across the world , Sophos chief scientist , Joshua Saxe put out a call on Twitter . Appalled that criminal groups were starting to incorporate references to COVID 19 into a range of crime campaigns , information security analysts more than 4 , 000 of them banded together in a collective show of defiance and formed the COVID 19 Cyber Threat Coalition ( CCTC ) in a Slack channel created that same day . This channel is building an enduring commons for the community to leverage in times of crisis , and is close to achieving not for profit status under the auspices of the CTA . Ultimately , these stories about sharing threat intelligence tell us about more than just the organizations themselves . As another parablethat of the blind man and the elephantteaches us , no one vendor can provide comprehensive or absolute truth through their subjective experiences alone . The true shape of complicated things emerges from the union of our experiences . These collaborative initiatives protected millions of people from becoming victims of cybercrime , but that alone was nt why they were successful . They thrived because the core motivation of their members and founders has been to , first , protect anyone who might be in harms way from harm . There was no profit motive , just a desire to defend those in need , while it seemed like the wolves were at the door . This proves the model is correct , and bridges critical gaps in coverage none of us alone could generate , but we can do more with it . As an industry , we may in the future want to consider sharing machine learning models , or training datasets , just as we share block lists or Yara rules today . We could also strengthen and contribute to emerging standards like STIX and the ATT&CK framework . And we could participate in industry   specific ISACs and ISAOs . The future will be more connected , and well all be better off ( and better protected ) for it . EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Sophos 2021 Threat Report covers topic areas into which Sophos has gained insight from the work over the past 12 months by SophosLabs on malware and spam analysis , and by the Sophos Rapid Response , Cloud Security , and Data Science teams . These aspects of our daily work protecting customers provide insight into the threat landscape that can guide incident responders and IT security professionals on where they should direct their efforts to defend networks and endpoints in the coming year . We 've segmented the report into four main parts : Discussion of how ransomware has transformed itself , and where this threat is headed ; analysis of the most common attacks large organizations face , and why these metaphorical canaries in the coal mine remain significant threats ; how the emergence of a global pandemic affected information security in 2020 ; and a survey of the scope of attacks targeting platforms not traditionally considered part of an enterprise 's attack surface . To summarize the key takeaways from the report : Ransomware Ransomware threat actors continue to innovate both their technology and their criminal modus operandi at an accelerating pace More ransomware groups now engage in data theft so they may threaten targets with extortion over the release of sensitive private data As ransom groups put more effort into active attacks against larger organizations , the ransoms they demand have risen precipitously Further , distinct threat actor groups that engage in ransomware attacks appear to be collaborating more closely with their peers in the criminal underground , behaving more like cybercrime cartels than independent groups Ransomware attacks that previously took weeks or days now may only require hours to complete ' Everyday ' threats Server platforms running both Windows and Linux have been heavily targeted for attack , and leveraged to attack organizations from within Common services like RDP and VPN concentrators remain a focus for attack on the network perimeter , and threat actors also use RDP to move laterally within breached networks Even low end "" commodity "" malware can lead to major breaches , as more malware families branch out into becoming "" content distribution networks "" for other malware A lack of attention to one or more aspects of basic security hygiene has been found to be at the root cause of many of the most damaging attacks we 've investigated COVID 19 Working from home presents new challenges , expanding an organization 's security perimeter to thousands of home networks protected by widely varying levels of security Cloud computing has successfully borne the brunt of a lot of enterprise needs for secure computing environments , yet still has its own challenges unique from those in a traditional enterprise network Threat actors have attempted to launder their reputations making promises not to target organizations involved in life   saving health operations , but later reneged on those promises Criminal enterprises have branched out into a service economy that eases new criminals into the fold Cybersecurity professionals from around the world self organized in 2020 into a rapid reaction force to combat threats that leverage the social engineering potential of anything relating to the novel Coronavirus Nontraditional platforms Attackers now routinely take advantage of the wealth of "" red team "" tools and utilities pioneered by penetration testers in live , active attacks Despite efforts on the part of operators of mobile platforms to monitor apps for malicious code , attackers continue to work around the edges , developing techniques to bypass these code scans Software classified in an earlier era as "" potentially unwanted "" because it delivered a plethora of advertisements ( but was otherwise not malicious ) has been engaging in tactics that are increasingly indistinguishable from overt malware Data scientists have applied approaches borrowed from the world of biological epidemiology to spam attacks and malware payloads , as a method to bridge gaps in detection THE FUTURE OF RANSOMWARE Ransomware attacks launched throughout 2020 magnified the suffering of an already wary population . As the pandemic ravaged lives and livelihoods , so did a host of ransomware families , whose efforts did not stop targeting the health and education sectors , even as hospitals became COVID 19 battlegrounds and schools struggled to invent an entirely new way to teach children through March and beyond . You ca nt raise enough in a bake sale during a pandemic to pay a ransom , but some schools managed to recover from attacks that appeared targeted at the first day of school , by keeping secure backups . Ransomware operators pioneered new ways to evade endpoint security products , spread rapidly , and even came up with a solution to the problem ( from their perspective ) of targeted individuals or companies having good backups , securely stored where the ransomware could nt harm them . But what appeared to be a wide variety of ransomware may not be as wide as it seems . As time went on , and we investigated an increasing number of attacks , Sophos analysts discovered that some ransomware code appeared to have been shared across families , and some of the ransomware groups appeared to work in collaboration more than in competition with one another . Given all this , its hard to make any kind of reliable prediction of what ransomware criminals will do next . Ransomware creators and operators have burned a lot of time working on defenses against endpoint security products . We counter their countermeasures . They show creativity and versatility in devising new tactics ; we show tenacity in studying what they do and finding clever ways to stop them . Data theft creates a secondary extortion market Until this year , conventional wisdom among security companies that had any experience at all with ransomware ran quite uniformly : Lock down obvious ingress methods , such as internet   facing RDP ports ; keep good offline backups ; and deal with infections of small , innocuous malware such as Dridex or Emotet quickly , before they can deliver the killing payload . Several high   profile ransom attacks , for instance , against school districts across the US , failed at least in part because the IT managers had maintained an unaffected backup of critical data . As a countermeasure to their victims preparedness , several ransomware families picked up on a side hustle designed to increase pressure on their victims to pay the ransom even if every backup with essential data was safe . Not only would they hold the machines hostage , but they would steal the data on those machines and threaten to release it to the world if the targets fail to pay a bounty . Over the past half year , Sophos analysts observed that ransomware adversaries have settled on a common ( and slowly growing ) toolset they use to exfiltrate data from a victims network . This toolset of well known , legitimate utilities anyone might have wo nt be detected by endpoint security products . The list of ransomware families that engage in this practice continues to grow , and now includes Doppelpaymer , REvil , Clop , DarkSide , Netwalker , Ragnar Locker , and Conti , among many others . The attackers operate leaks sites , where they publicize what data they ve stolen ; REvil allows anyone to buy the data from them right from its website . The criminals use the toolset to copy sensitive internal information , compress it into an archive , and transfer it out of the network and out of reach of the victim . These are some of the tools we ve seen used , so far : Total Commander ( file manager with built in FTP Client ) 7zip ( Archive creation software ) WinRAR ( Archive creation software ) psftp ( PuTTYs SFTP client ) Windows cURL When it comes to data theft , the attackers are far less picky and exfiltrate entire folders , regardless of the file types that are contained within . ( Ransomware typically prioritizes the encryption portion of the attack to key file types and excludes many others . ) Size does nt matter . They do nt seem to care about the amount of data targeted for exfiltration . Directory structures are unique to each business , and some file types can be compressed better than others . We have seen as little as 5 GB , and as much as 400 GB , of compressed data being stolen from a victim prior to deployment of the ransomware . Fiig . 1 . In October , 2020 , the Doppelpaymer ransomware leaks page revealed that the attackers had struck the networks of Hall County , Georgia . The leak included a reference to a file called elections which included sample ballot proofs for the state primary elections in 2020 and lists of poll workers and their phone numbers from the 2018 elections , among other sensitive files . The Associated Press reported that the ransomware encrypted the signature verification database the county uses to validate ballots . Source : SophosLabs . The criminals typically send the exfiltrated data to legitimate cloud storage services , which make this activity harder to spot , since these are common , ordinary network traffic destinations . For attackers , the following three cloud storage services have been the most popular go to for storing exfiltrated data : Google Drive Amazon S3 ( Simple Storage Service ) Mega . nz Private FTP servers In a final act of destruction , ransomware attackers increasingly hunt for the local servers that contain backups of critical data ; when found , they delete ( or independently encrypt ) these backups just before the network wide encryption attack . Its more important than ever to store a backup of key data offline . If they can find it , the ransomware criminals will destroy it . Ransoms rise as attacks increase Its hard to believe that just two years ago , Sophos analysts marveled at the $ 6 million haul brought in by the operators of the ransomware known as SamSam . In an attack Sophos responded to in 2020 , the ransomware operators opened their negotiations at a dollar amount of more than twice what the SamSam gang earned in 32 months of operation . Ransomware comes in weight classes , now : heavyweights that attack large enterprise networks , welterweights that target civil society ( public safety and local government ) and small to medium businesses , and featherweights that target individual computers and home users . While earning the dubious distinction of being the heaviest heavyweight sounds impressive , it is nt fair to compare high ransom demands to those that originate from the lower end of the ransomware spectrum . Sophos has a dedicated team that investigates , and often works with the targets of , ransomware attacks . The team can forensically reconstruct the events of an attack after the fact , and sometimes disrupt attacks while they re still in progress . The Sophos Rapid Response team gets involved in cases when there s a chance to stop or limit the harm , but sometimes the attack happens so fast , there s nothing it can do , and the target must then decide whether or not to pay the ransom , at which point , Sophos is no longer involved . That s where companies like Coveware come in . The company represents ransomware targets , as a high   stakes negotiator with their attackers . Covewares CTO Alex Holdtman confirmed our suspicion , that ransomware heavyweights are the primary driving factor in the demand for sky   high ransoms . Average ransom payouts , quarterly Q4 2019 $ 84 , 116 . 00 Q1 2020 $ 111 , 605 . 17 Q2 2020 $ 178 , 254 . 19 Q3 2020 $ 233 , 817 . 30 Fig . 2 . The average ransom demand has risen 21 % in the past quarter and has nearly tripled over the past year . Source : Coveware . In just the past quarter , the average ransom payout has risen by 21 % , but Coveware believes the averages can be skewed by just one or two very large ransom attacks . The average ransom payout in the just completed quarter is now the equivalent of $ 233 , 817 . 30 , payable in cryptocurrency . A year ago , the average payout was $ 84 , 116 . Ransomware threat actors understand how expensive downtime can be , and have been testing the upper limit of what they can extract in a ransom attack . Several ransomware families have taken up extortion as a side hustle to help close the deal . As mentioned earlier in our report , groups such as Netwalker and others are using this tactic . That way , even if the target of the attack has perfectly recoverable backups of their data , they may still be forced to pay in the hopes the ransomware criminals do nt publish their internal information to the world . At the lower end of the ransomware spectrum , demands have been increasing , but Holdtman says they re nowhere near the big fish . There are a lot of small businesses and individuals that get hit , but for them the ransom demands have remained relatively flat . EVERYDAY THREATS TO ENTERPRISES CANARIES IN THE COAL MINE If everything you know about cyberattacks comes from news reports , you could be forgiven for thinking the sky was falling . Attacks that target large organizations happen every day , but they re not all the kind of black swan events , like a major data breach , that can send a companys fortunes ( or stock price ) tumbling and generate bad publicity . Many attacks are far more mundane , involving malware the SophosLabs team tracks in a sort of Most Wanted list of The Usual Suspects . But though these attacks , and some of the malware they deliver , are well understood and easily contained , every attack carries with it the potential to get far worse if it is nt dealt with speedily and effectively . To carry the bird metaphor forward , these routine , everyday attacks represent canaries in the coal mine , an early indication of a toxic presence that could quickly spiral out of control . Attacks targeting Windows & Linux servers While the vast majority of security incidents we responded to in 2020 involved desktop or laptop computers running variations of Windows , we saw a steady increase in attacks on both Windows and non   Windows servers . In general , servers have long been attractive attack targets for a variety of reasons : They often run for long periods unattended or unmonitored ; servers often carry more CPU and memory capacity than individual laptops ; and servers may occupy a privileged space on the network , often having access to the most sensitive and valuable data in an organizations operation . This makes them an attractive foothold for a persistent attacker . These characteristics wo nt change in 2021 and Sophos anticipates the volume of attacks targeting servers will continue to increase . The majority of attacks targeting servers fit one of three profiles ransomware , cryptominers and data exfiltration each of which has a corresponding , distinct set of tactics and techniques the attackers employ . Best practices for server admins is to avoid running conventional desktop apps , like email clients or a web browser , from the server as a safeguard against infections , so attacks targeting servers necessarily require a shift in tactics . Internet   facing servers running Windows receive a never ending barrage of RDP brute forcing attempts , an attack tactic that , for at least the past three years , has been most often associated with ( and predictive of ) ransomware attacks . The Sophos Rapid Response team frequently finds that the root cause of ransomware attacks it investigates involve an initial access to the targets network by means of RDP , and then the use of those machines to gain a foothold within the network and take control of DC servers , from which they can mount the rest of the attack . By contrast , cryptojacking attacks tend to target a wider range of vulnerabilities in Windows , and in applications that normally run on server hardware , such as database software . For instance , one method used by the Lemon_Duck cryptominer involves a brute force attack against internet   facing servers running Microsoft SQL Server . Once the attackers guess the correct database password , they use the database itself to reassemble the cryptojacker payload , write it out to the servers file system , and execute it . The infected machine then attempts to exploit the EternalBlue and/or SMBGhost vulnerabilities in a bid to spread the cryptojacker . Lemon_Duck is an equal opportunity attacker , and can infect Linux servers . The malware attempts to brute force SSH passwords taken from a relatively small list . If successful , the attackers load malicious shellcode , which then establishes persistence by taking advantage of loopholes in a service called Redis . The cryptojacker can also conceal itself by executing the commands to start itself from within Hadoop clusters . Fig . 3 . One of the more prolific cryptojackers , called MyKings , distributed the components responsible for installing the botnet ( highlighted in green ) inside a Zip archive along with several of the exploits leaked from the NSA by the Shadow Brokers . Source : SophosLabs . Occasionally , attackers target servers because , rather than a quick payday or a steady trickle of cryptocurrency , they want to steal data of value stored on them . In 2020 , Sophos discovered an attacker targeting Linux servers using malware we called Cloud Snooper . The servers in question were hosted in a cloud computing cluster , and evaded detection by inventing a clever message relay system , piggybacking their command and control messages on routine HTTP connections . Fig . 4 . A wolf in sheeps clothing metaphor illustration of how the Cloud Snooper APT malware concealed its commands and exfiltrated data in the guise of conventional HTTP requests and responses , with the help of a tool that monitored network traffic and rewrote TCP / IP packets in real time . Source : SophosLabs . Server admins have not , historically , installed endpoint protection products on servers , but with the advent of these types of attacks , that conventional wisdom has shifted . Underestimate commodity malware at your peril Not everybody gets hit with a zero day vulnerability by a nation state   sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat ( APT ) . Most attacks involve run of the mill malware delivered by conventional means which typically involve a spam email , a benign looking attachment or link , and a lot of encouragement for the target to open that attachment . Sophos receives thousands of telemetry hits per month about such common malware , usually an indication that a computer protected by one of our products has blocked the attack . In unprotected computers , where the malware can fully execute , it will profile the targets computer ; extract any login credentials or saved passwords for websites that control something of value ( usually , but not limited to , bank or financial services accounts ) ; then send that information back to its operators and await further instructions , which may arrive in a few seconds . . . or several days later . But do nt let the fact that these malware families are merely ordinary lull you into a false sense of security . These malicious workhorses can cause huge problems if allowed to persist . As mentioned earlier in our report , the SophosLabs team maintains a Most Wanted malware list , with analysts dedicated to those families that remain stubbornly persistent . We ve put together a short summary of some of them below . Dridex and Zloader One of the most common malware types is the loader . Loaders have features centered around delivering another malware payload on behalf of their operators or people who contract with their operators . The Dridex and Zloader malware families are both mature , established loader platforms . Attackers use both Dridex and Zloader to collect information about the target system and send it back to the criminals , who can decide at their leisure what components or payloads they will deliver , based on the information the bot sends back . The Dridex loaders core function is to contact its command and control ( C2 ) server , retrieve one or more encrypted payloads , and deploy them . Its very hard for analysts to get those payloads because the threat actors only distribute them on an as needed basis , such as a hidden VNC ( a remote control application ) , or a SOCKS proxy . These payloads give attackers the ability to do things in the context of the users device . They also allow the criminals to access resources on the victim system that are not directly reachable from their own system . The server side logic that determines what happens during an infection can be inscrutable , but we can infer some rules because the bots do nt want to infect computers used by malware analysts . "

RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs .

In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","malware","MALWARE","Google_Play","ORG","Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names .

In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository .

At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","Trojans","MALWARE","camera","PRODUCT","Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository .

At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","malware","MALWARE","Google","ORG","Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months .

"sophos-2021-threat-report","hascharacteristics","trojan","MALWARE","Google","ORG","We run all newly discovered remote access trojan ( RAT ) malware samples through our internal sandbox system . This table illustrates how many new , unique samples we encountered over a seven month period that we later classified to one of the 18 most common RAT families , broken out by the family names . * Partial month data . Source : SophosLabs . Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations . RDP login attempts per honeypot London 508 , 320 Ohio 536 , 772 Ireland 590 , 441 Frankfurt 521 , 778 California 457 , 725 Mumbai 266 , 448 Paris 466 , 716 Singapore 236 , 490 So Paulo 410 , 143 Sydney 303 , 680 Fig . 7 . We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute force their way in . The honeypot machines were discovered organically , without being advertised in any way . Over the 1 month period of our tests , this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot location received . The impact of the COVID 19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem , as increasing numbers of organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational . The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the public   facing internet . If the RDP password is weak , easily guessed or brute forced through automated login attempts , the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure . The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the top root causes of the ransomware events they handle . The advice to IT managers remains the same as it has all along : RDP should never face the public internet , but instead be placed behind a firewall that requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero trust facility first ; and admins should strengthen Windows password policies to require longer passwords and a multi factor authentication token or app . In research performed before the lockdown took effect , Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become . Over a 30 day period , the honeypots received a median average of 467 , 000 RDP login attempts , or about 600 per hour at each location . The research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login attempts until we finally pulled the plug .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam . Fig . 10 . After the target has acknowledged the initial request , the fraudster makes the ask    providing a pretext that appears plausible . Source : SophosLabs . BEC scams rely on the target of the scam ( the employee ) being physically distant from the subject of the scam ( the executive ) , and it also depends on the target acting quickly , before anyone can figure out what s going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers . BEC scammers may craft a message when they know the executive is out of the office on business . These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back and forth between the attacker and target . The conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into a series of messages that eventually lead to an ask to make a purchase based on a plausible sounding pretext . Fig . 11 . At some point during the attack , the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense , like a request to make a sudden , large wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scams target . This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request : Why would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they re going to be handed out as gifts ? Source : SophosLabs . Back when most of us were working in offices , physical proximity between the target and subject would have made the scam immediately apparent . But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them . The more real employees get involved in handling these requests , the more likely it will be that the scam will be discovered before any damage is done . Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms . COVID 19 and Coronavirus Email Scams on the Rise 3 % 2 . 68 % 2 . 5 % % of total spam volume 2 . 25 % 1 . 99 % 1 . 74 % 1 . 77 % 1 . 42 % 1 . 5 % 1 . 33 % 1 . 31 % 1 . 19 % 1 . 36 % 1 . 08 % 1 . 01 % 0 . 75 % 0 . 72 % 0 . 59 % 0 . 58 % 0 % 19 20 16 17 15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 21 06 18 March Fig . 13 . Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names .

In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups .

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing Business email compromise ( BEC ) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around a fraudulent request for money . In a BEC attack , a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to look like they originate from a high   level executive within a company , directing someone at a lower level to perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive . Attackers may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails ( sometimes called Business Email Spoofing ) or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization 's own mail server , and use that account to send the fraudulent request . Fig . 9 . In this real world example of a business    email compromise attempt , the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent request . The email has a different Reply To address ( from a Gmail account ) than the one in the From : header , a dead giveaway that something is awry if the target is paying attention to the mail headers . Source : SophosLabs . BEC attackers , posing as an executive , may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or expedite a financial transaction of some kind . The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted individuals and organizations . BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam , because they fail to follow spam like patterns ; they ( often ) do nt contain an attachment or malicious link , and they try to look like they originated from within the targeted organization , at times even incorporating the target organizations typical mail signatures or other elements that may be familiar to employees , to make them more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam .

But our current distributed work environment , where both the executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity , reduces the opportunities for people to just walk over to someones desk and ask them to confirm the request . BEC scams existed prior to the COVID 19 era , but as more people are working remotely , BEC scammers are on the prowl . As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive , it is a particularly offensive type of scam . If you encounter emails like these , trust your gut and speak to the subject in question directly , if you can , or ask for guidance from someone else if you ca nt reach them .

Weird science : retro Office glitch strikes again When it comes to malicious office documents ( maldocs ) and the exploits they attempt to deploy , what s old is often used again and again , goes away after Microsoft produces an update , and then ( sometimes ) resurfaces . For years , SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety of exploits into maldocs . Newly disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload , because not everyone installs patches right away , and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective safety net defense , based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector . Most of the maldocs we ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders that give attackers a literal point and click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit ( s ) to craft into the malicious document . As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern exploits , which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document , maldoc creators seem to have dug deep to find a very , very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the documents . The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit , though it really is nt an exploit at all . In fact , VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003 , although we did nt see it abused until 2013 , when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE 2012   0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of the glitch . An Excel spreadsheet or Word . doc marked as read only is just a password    protected document with a stock password of , you guessed it , VelvetSweatshop . We ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a way to evade advanced threat detection . Because of the encryption , the real malicious content is hidden behind strong crypto that scanners ca nt crack , and ca nt scan unless they support the latest algorithm used by attackers . Due to the use of the default   password , Excel opens the decoded content without prompting for the password , so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent . Endpoint security programs added support for the encryption and the default password , but the criminals keep finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not ( yet ) implemented by AV scanners . It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that , if it were human , would be in its last year of school . But its no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it . COVID 19 AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS The novel coronavirus , COVID 19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity . Attackers felt emboldened to target the newly homebound white collar workforce . An already high level of anxiety and fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns , ransomware that targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure , and every manner of rent seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper . Home is the new perimeter Everything normal ended in March 2020 , when workers who could work remotely , and students at almost all levels , were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID 19 and relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals . Suddenly , we were nt so much working from home as living at work . Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office . Demand for VPN access and multifactor authentication services surged . Chromebooks became rare commodities . Zoom went through about ten years worth of evolutionary growth in two months . And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names .

In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources . Along with VPNs , organizations found they needed to add new firewalls and other security appliances , deployments of modern unified threat management systems supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services . In the pre   COVID 19 world , VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly outnumbered traveling or remote workers . As March turned into May and then June , for these workers , the VPN became an essential lifeline ( if not the essential lifeline ) that kept organizations in operation . But those organizations also quickly realized that employees should nt use personal devices from home to access the VPN , and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce . Without enough physical machines , for the time being , organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a secure computing workspace . That began the second wave the virtual desktop wave . As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop , the move to hosting those desktops in the cloud made practical and cost sense , but they still required protection . Suddenly , IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs , and suddenly needed visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers , virtual desktops , and other cloud services the cloud management wave .

A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository . The attacker discovered , then used those credentials to attack , using the native cloud providers APIs spinning up hundreds of VM instances to mine Bitcoin . At the same time , they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate . Later , they revoked access to other legitimate users . Source : SophosLabs . The COVID 19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life , including how many work . In a recent survey by Reuters , 97 % of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped up their transition to new technology . But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty , nearly one out of every three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost effective a way possible . In Sophos most recent Cloud Security Report , we found that the majority of security incidents involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes : stolen or phished credentials , or misconfigurations that led to breaches . Seven out of ten of the more than 3 , 700 IT professionals surveyed for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months prior to the survey . NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN : THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that do nt look like a computer or server : routers , mobile phones , firewalls , smart TVs , streaming boxes , VoIP boxes , cameras and camera doorbells , network attached storage , some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances , and on and on . But just because they do nt look like traditional computers , it does nt mean they ca nt be misused or abused in the same way . Android Joker malware growing in volume Android users find themselves in the middle of an arms race between Google ( which owns the Android platform and its primary Google Play Store ) and malware creators who want their malware listed for download on the Google Play Store . Google has spent years on a system designed to inspect source code of Android apps submitted for inclusion in the Google Play Store , in search of chunks of code that indicate a malicious intent or an undesirable outcome for an Android user .

Source : SophosLabs . Remote Access Trojans , or RATs , and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware . As the name suggests , RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely . Infostealers also hew close to their name , engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials , certificates , and other sensitive information . Two of the Most Wanted families we ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla ( an infostealer ) and RATicate ( a RAT ) . Like loaders , RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads , including updated versions of themselves . We ve observed RATicate distributing other malware including Agent Tesla . We ve also seen these RAT families being served up from , or communicating with , the same IP addresses or servers , which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups . Trickbots takedown Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years . The infamous botnet pioneered a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics : for instance , it communicated with its C2 infrastructure using TLS . The bot is implicated in several high   profile ransomware attacks and is a competent credential thief in its own right . Fig . 6 . Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code . Source : SophosLabs . In October 2020 , as we prepared this report , Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnets command and control system that caused some 90 % of the botnet to stop communicating with the command and control infrastructure . Investigators managed to upload a poisoned configuration into Trickbots infrastructure that each bot downloaded . The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command and control server was the infected machine it was running on . The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions . The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbots operator , but they re expected to slowly , eventually , return to normal operation . Delivery mechanisms There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate a network . The methods of most malware attacks follow a well worn path that may include the use of email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file , or the attacker may take a more active role targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter , facing the public internet . RDP , the # 1 attack vector for ransomware The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol , or RDP , is a standard service available in all current versions of Windows . With very little effort , RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer when not physically in the presence of that computer , which can be great in the case of a pandemic where everyone is suddenly forced to work from home . Unfortunately , for the past three years , ransomware threat actors have been abusing ( at an accelerating rate ) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a foothold and cause large scale damage to enterprises , earning them an increasingly large payday from targeted organizations .

And through it all , Microsoft , Adobe , Apple , and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms .

Globally , a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID 19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown . Source : SophosLabs . COVID 19 turned us all into our own IT departments , managing patches , security updates , and connectivity issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom . Demand soared for headsets , microphones , better lighting , and security both on the network and the endpoint . And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing , spam , online trolls , cyberbullying and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game , ready to play . It has nt been easy , and were still not operating where we were in February 2020 , but many people are finding the new normal might , in some ways , be an improvement . More offices have decided to continue allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace , which will have a significant benefit to both the environment and to peoples quality of life . As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their remote locations , circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks role as the last line of defense . The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter . We need a complete rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth . Crimeware as a service It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup . Scrappy at first , the successful makers eventually earn a loyal following . And there can be just as many business models for malicious software as there are for legitimate software . The term crimeware is intentionally broad ; some creators of malware , or of the tools that enable malware to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features , do nt sell their product outright , but license it as you might buy a one year license for the Adobe Creative Suite . We ve called this class of business model crimeware as a service , ( CaaS ) and it seems poised to be the new normal . One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet . The spam delivered trojan has been around for years , and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would be criminal . Emotet is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders . Emotet exists primarily to deliver other malware to a targets computer . It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets . Fig . 14 . Source : SophosLabs . Emotet , however , has gone through two dark periods so far this year . The malware remained in communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five month period in which the spam emails that normally deliver attacks evaporated completely . Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July . Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note . Unlike its pricier relations , Dharma maintains a fixed , small ransom . The reason comes down to Dharmas business model : Its the ransomware with training wheels on , for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes . Those criminals pay essentially a subscription fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators , and split the proceeds of any attacks with them . As attackers branch out into specialties and sub specialties , it seems the business model in which criminals work with independent contractors , freelancers and affiliates is one that does nt seem to be going away anytime soon . Spam , scams , and broken promises The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email . In the best of times , the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient act on the message . This is a well known psychological trick , because if you take a couple of moments to think about the contents of the spam message , you ll probably realize its a fake . If the spammer triggers a fear reaction , you act before you think , and you get snared in the trap . COVID 19 already had everyone on a hair trigger , so spammers did nt even have to try particularly hard . Fig . 15 . Source : SophosLabs . A few weeks into the lockdown , we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon : Domain registrations . Within weeks , people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that contained any combination of the strings COVID 19 , Corona , or virus . Fig . 16 . Source : SophosLabs . Some of the sites were obvious jokes , while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate , regional or national health authorities . We also hunted for COVID 19   related domains and subdomains in TLS certificate transparency logs . Certificate transparency logs are useful for tracking subdomains that have their own TLS certificates information that does nt show up in raw domain registration data and domain names .

Throughout the early months of the COVID 19 crisis , people registered thousands of domains and licensed at least that many TLS certificates per day , whose names contained the string COVID 19 or corona .

TLS certificate registrations that referred to the pandemic spiked at about the same time as the domain registrations . Source : SophosLabs . We saw an average of over 200 certificate requests for COVID 19 domains per day in March , and the rate continued to climb in the subsequent months . By June , the average reached 625 a day . In October , that rate peaked at 951 new TLS certificates that were being requested , per day . Most of these domains continue to be legitimate or benign , though many remain parked and have no contenta sign that the registrant may be domain aging , and setting aside these domains for future reputation check ups .

A small percentage ( below one percent ) have been identified as being associated with phishing or malware . Many are ephemeral , with hostnames that can no longer be resolved after as little as a day . Remote work raises the importance of secure cloud computing When the COVID 19 lockdowns began in March 2020 , people and workplaces began a rapid and unprecedented transition that continues to this day . How we work , go to school , attend events and conferences , and entertain ourselves may have changed forever , and cloud computing was an essential element of that rapid evolution , but it faces a lot of challenges . The overprovisioning of access permissions , limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a lack of auditing , can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else . For instance , cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud . The computing   cycles heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines , and run up the electricity bill ; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances : The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies worth of cryptocurrency . Further , many dispersed , remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks , where criminals locked down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines . After all , ransomware can encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage . Organizations whose cloud infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent encrypting the data , but for the ransom , too . Organizations suffering security incidents in the last year Malware 34 % Exposed Data 29 % 28 % Ransomware Account Compromise 25 % Cryptojacking 17 % 0 % 40 % 30 % 20 % 10 % Fig . 20 . In our 2020 Cloud Security Report , Sophos surveyed more than 3 , 500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud , and found that many of the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones . Source : SophosLabs . On lockdown , IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before many workplaces closed down . The big changes COVID 19 demanded came in three waves . In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began , the first wave an access wave began to take shape . As millions of workers , suddenly unable to go to their workplace , needed to access resources inside their organizations environment , rapidly growing demand for virtual private network ( VPN ) or other zero trust facility access overwhelmed existing resources .
