ICS - CERT strongly encourages asset owners and operators to use these indicators to look for signs of compromise within their control systems environments . Asset owners and operators can request access to this information by emailing ics-cert@dhs.gov Any positive or suspected findings should be immediately reported to ICS - CERT for further analysis and correlation . ICS - CERT strongly encourages taking immediate defensive action to secure ICS systems using defense - in - depth principles . CSSP Recommended Practices , https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/Recommended-Practices , web site last accessed October 28 , 2014 . Asset owners should not assume that their control systems are deployed securely or that they are not operating with an Internet accessible configuration . Instead , asset owners should thoroughly audit their networks for Internet facing devices , weak authentication methods , and component vulnerabilities . Control systems often have Internet accessible devices installed without the ownerâ€ ™ s knowledge , putting those systems at increased risk of attack . ICS - CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation due to this unsecure device configuration of these vulnerabilities . Specifically , users should : Minimize network exposure for all control system devices . Control system devices should not directly face the Internet . Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls , and isolate them from the business network . If remote access is required , employ secure methods , such as Virtual Private Networks ( VPNs ) , recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices . "

ICS - CERT strongly encourages asset owners and operators to use these indicators to look for signs of compromise within their control systems environments . Asset owners and operators can request access to this information by emailing ics-cert@dhs.gov Any positive or suspected findings should be immediately reported to ICS - CERT for further analysis and correlation . ICS - CERT strongly encourages taking immediate defensive action to secure ICS systems using defense - in - depth principles . CSSP Recommended Practices , https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/Recommended-Practices , web site last accessed October 28 , 2014 . Asset owners should not assume that their control systems are deployed securely or that they are not operating with an Internet accessible configuration . Instead , asset owners should thoroughly audit their networks for Internet facing devices , weak authentication methods , and component vulnerabilities . Control systems often have Internet accessible devices installed without the ownerâ€ ™ s knowledge , putting those systems at increased risk of attack . ICS - CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation due to this unsecure device configuration of these vulnerabilities . Specifically , users should : Minimize network exposure for all control system devices . Control system devices should not directly face the Internet . Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls , and isolate them from the business network . If remote access is required , employ secure methods , such as Virtual Private Networks ( VPNs ) , recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices . "

In addition , we recommend that all Cimplicity users review ICSCERT advisory ICSA-14 - 023 - 01 and apply the recommended mitigations . WINCC While ICS - CERT lacks definitive information on how WinCC systems are being compromised by BlackEnergy , there are indications that one of the vulnerabilities fixed with the latest update for SIMATIC WinCC may have been exploited by the BlackEnergy malware.g ICS - CERT strongly encourages users of WinCC , TIAPortal , and PCS7 to update their software to the most recent version as soon as possible . Please see Siemens SecurityAdvisorySSA-134508 and andICS - CERT advisory ICSA-14 - 329 - 02D for additional details . ADVANTECH / BROADWIN WEBACCESS Anumber of the victims associated with this campaign were running theAdvantech / BroadWin WebAccess software with a direct Internet connection . We have not yet identified the initial infection vector for victims running this platform but believe it is being targeted . DETECTION YARA SIGNATURE ---------Begin Update C Part 2 of 2 ------- ICS - CERT has published instruction for how to use the YARAsignature for typical information technology environments . ICS - CERT recommends a phased approach to utilize this YARAsignature in an industrial control systems ( ICSs ) environment . Test the use of the signature in the test / quality assurance / development ICS environment if one exists . If not , deploy the signature against backup or alternate systems in the top end of the ICS environment ; this signature will not be usable on the majority of field devices . ---------End Update C Part 2 of 2 ------- ICS - CERT has produced a Yara signature to aid in identifying if the malware files are present on a given system . This signature is provided â€as isâ€ and has not been fully tested for all variations or environments . Any positive or suspected findings should be immediately reported to ICS - CERT for further analysis and correlation . The Yara signature is available at : /sites / default / files / file_attach / ICS - ALERT-14 - 281 - 01.yara YARAis a pattern - matching tool used to by computer security researchers and companies to help identify malware .

ICS - CERT strongly encourages asset owners and operators to use these indicators to look for signs of compromise within their control systems environments . Asset owners and operators can request access to this information by emailing ics-cert@dhs.gov Any positive or suspected findings should be immediately reported to ICS - CERT for further analysis and correlation . ICS - CERT strongly encourages taking immediate defensive action to secure ICS systems using defense - in - depth principles . CSSP Recommended Practices , https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/Recommended-Practices , web site last accessed October 28 , 2014 . Asset owners should not assume that their control systems are deployed securely or that they are not operating with an Internet accessible configuration . Instead , asset owners should thoroughly audit their networks for Internet facing devices , weak authentication methods , and component vulnerabilities . Control systems often have Internet accessible devices installed without the ownerâ€ ™ s knowledge , putting those systems at increased risk of attack . ICS - CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation due to this unsecure device configuration of these vulnerabilities . Specifically , users should : Minimize network exposure for all control system devices . Control system devices should not directly face the Internet . Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls , and isolate them from the business network . If remote access is required , employ secure methods , such as Virtual Private Networks ( VPNs ) , recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices . "
