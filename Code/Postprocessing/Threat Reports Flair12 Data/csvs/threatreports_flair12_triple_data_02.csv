In this white paper , we will offer insight into the modus operandi of the attackers and provide a technical analysis of the malware used in the attacks . 2 THE ATTACKS Operation In(ter)ception attacks we investigated progressed through several phases , described below . 2.1 . Initial compromise The attackers used LinkedIn to target employees within the chosen companies . To initiate contact , they approached the targets with fictitious job offers using LinkedIn¡¯s messaging feature . In order to appear credible , the attackers posed as representatives of well - known , existing companies in the aerospace and defense industry . For each of the targeted companies we investigated , the attackers had created a separate fake LinkedIn account : one impersonating an HR manager from Collins Aerospace ( formerly Rockwell Collins ) , a major US supplier of aerospace and defense products ; the other posing as an HR representative of General Dynamics , another large US - based corporation with a similar focus . ( Note : These LinkedIn accounts no longer exist . ) Figure 1 shows a fake job offer message sent under the Collins Aerospace ruse . Once the contact was established , the attackers snuck malicious files into the communication , disguising them as documents related to the advertised job offer . Figure 2 shows an example of such communication , in which the attackers impersonated General Dynamics . "

"2020-07-the-fake-cisco","indicates","C2960X Boot Loader","PRODUCT","three","CARDINAL","All three devices underwent the same extraction procedure . First , the chips were removed from the boards . Then , Flash content extraction was performed with the Elnec BeeProg2 with 70 - 3170 TSOP56 adapter , using the Elnec software PG4UW . Content inspection showed the chips were written with bytes swapped with 16 - bit words , thus requiring a quick adjustment to accommodate for that . Three images were obtained , each 128 MB in size . After content extraction , the Flash chips were installed back on the boards to return them to an operable state . 2.7 Flash content analysis The main purpose behind this step was to gather intelligence on how data was stored on the physical medium , and whether there was anything not accounted for during the live system analysis step performed before , such as bootloader code , any signatures , etc . A quick content inspection using the entropy graphing feature of the binwalk tool showed us several areas of interest . . The high - entropy area of about 20 M bytes was probably the main software image , fitting the size and the entropy level as compressed data has high entropy . What followed were two areas of distinct entropy footprints , likely some sort of uncompressed data . The zero - entropy area is where the same 0xFF value was written and can be considered empty . At the very end , there were several small but distinct blocks of data After manual inspection at the very beginning of the image and direct binary comparison , we concluded that no bootloader code of any kind was placed there ; the data looked more like a file system . Supporting that assumption was the difference in the composition of the blocks on the devices . Therefore , it made more sense to assume bootloader code was located at the end of the Flash ; this was supported by the similar - looking entropy graph for all images towards the end . Indeed , inspecting the last megabyte revealed the presence of what appeared to be two bootloader programs , easily identified with the help of embedded strings ( examples from Counterfeit A ): C2960X Boot Loader ( C2960X - BROM ) Version 15.2(2r)E1 , RELEASE SOFTWARE ( fc1 ) Compiled We d 23 - Apr-14 02:21 by abhakat and C2960X Boot Loader ( C2960X - HBOOT - M ) Version 15.2(2r)E1 , RELEASE SOFTWARE ( fc1 ) Compiled We d 23 - Apr-14 02:21 by abhakat "
