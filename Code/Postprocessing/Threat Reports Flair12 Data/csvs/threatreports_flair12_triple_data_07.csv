"Russian-Bank-Offices","usesaddress","Slipknot Snuff","WORK_OF_ART","#1","CARDINAL","The disgruntled banking customer was consistent throughout ; illustrated below are a few attachment examples : Exploit attachment # 1 was deployed with the following names in Russian : ....... .. ...... docx ( "" Account statement "" ) ....... .. ...... docx ( "" Card statement "" ) ............ ....... docx ( "" Personal information "" ) Exploit attachment # 2 was deployed with the following names : ....... .. ...... docx ( or “ Card statement ” ) ....... .. ..... ........ docx ( or “ Customer card statement ” ) Exploit attachment # 3 was deployed using the following name : ........ docx ( or “ Statement ” ) Note : Hashes of all samples will be included in theAppendix of this analysis . As of 10August 2017 , RSAFirstWatch has high confidence that multiple individuals at many Russian banks were targeted with these malicious attachments , and believe this campaign was subsequentlybroughtto the attention oftheCentralBankofRussia ’s FinCERTby one or more ofthebanks beingtargeted . On17August2017,the daywewerefinishing upthis analysis , a new sample was discovered being deployed , with a different C2 node and slightly different communication . An exploit in someone else ’s wrapper ? Before we get to details about the exploit used in this campaign , we should cover some history on EPS exploits in docx files . FireEye discovered a malicious docx exploiting a zero day vulnerability in Microsoft ’s Encapsulated Postscript ( EPS ) filter , in the summer of 2015 . This EPS exploit was assigned CVE-2015 - 2545 . In March 2017 , FireEye observed both nation state and financially motivated actors using EPS zero day exploits assigned as CVE-2017 - 0261 and CVE-2017 - 0262 , prior to Microsoft disabling EPS rendering in its Office products with an update inApril 2017 . So it is likely one of these three EPS exploits is being employed with the perpetrator activity under investigation , perhaps hoping that their targets have n’t applied theApril patch that would make every EPS exploit futile . Since docx files are just a Zip - compressed container , comparing them with a file tree view might be a quick way to assess similarity on a high level . In fact , all 23 known docx files used in this campaign are very nearly identical , with the same 12 component files . Varying checksums might have to do with build artifacts , perhaps even intentionally so , in order to generate a unique hash with each build . Figure 3 Tree view of docx container file used to target Russian banks last week Interesting enough 10 of these 12 docx component files ( everything but the image1.eps and document.xml files ) are datedApril 18 th . This is no coincidence ; in fact , those same docx component files were found in the attachment used by nation - state actors in their email targeting of an Eastern European Ministry of ForeignAffairs , back when this EPS exploit was still a zero day ( Figure 4 ) . Figure 4 Eastern European Ministry of Foreign Affairs targeted by suspected nation state actors So if we compare the tree view of that older docx container ( Figure 5 ) , we see that 10 of the same component files appear identical , and we can confirm that using cryptographic hashing . Figure 5 Tree view of "" Trump "" exploit docx container , with 10 of 12 files identical to 23 recent RU bank targeting samples described in this investigation Of special note is the common app.xml file , which comes directly from the decoy document in the “ Trump ” exploit file . This app.xml file contains the same URLto the California Courier website(www[.]thecaliforniacourier[.]com ) , where the textwascopiedfrom “ Trump’sAttackonSyria : Wrongfor soManyReasons ” as describedbyESETin theirexploit analysis . Clearly there was some “ borrowing ” going on between this current bank - targeting campaign and the previous nation - state espionage campaign . Does this suggest that these campaigns and actors are in any way complicit / related ? No . On the contrary , national interests seem to imply that those particular espionage - focused actors ( i.e. , from the “ Trump ” campaign ) would almost certainly NOT be involved in broadly exploiting Russian banks a few months later . That being said , an alternative hypothesis is that these bank - targeting actors purposely purloined the older espionage related docx files to introduce uncertainty and/or mis - attribution , or even to send a message to defenders or researchers . As we 'll see shortly , the attackers also interestingly signed ( commented ) their malware with lyrics from Slipknot 's Snuff .

Figure 1 Phishing email targeting Russia bank # 1 , machine translation in red boxes Figure 2 is a screenshot of another phishing email obtained by RSAFirstWatch , targeting “ Russia bank # 2 . ” While this email is part of the same campaign , note that the body text , subject lines , file name , and @mail.com sender email is different from that targeting Russia bank # 1 , suggesting at least some manual actor modifications to the phishing email construction . Figure 2 Phishing email targeting Russia bank # 1 , machine translation in red boxes RSAFirstWatch identified 23 such attachments in this campaign , all using what appeared to be the exact same EPS exploit . The disgruntled banking customer was consistent throughout ; illustrated below are a few attachment examples : Exploit attachment # 1 was deployed with the following names in Russian : ....... .. ...... docx ( "" Account statement "" ) ....... .. ...... docx ( "" Card statement "" ) ............ ....... docx ( "" Personal information "" ) Exploit attachment # 2 was deployed with the following names : ....... .. ...... docx ( or “ Card statement ” ) ....... .. ..... ........ docx ( or “ Customer card statement ” ) Exploit attachment # 3 was deployed using the following name : ........ docx ( or “ Statement ” ) Note : Hashes of all samples will be included in theAppendix of this analysis . As of 10August 2017 , RSAFirstWatch has high confidence that multiple individuals at many Russian banks were targeted with these malicious attachments , and believe this campaign was subsequentlybroughtto the attention oftheCentralBankofRussia ’s FinCERTby one or more ofthebanks beingtargeted . On17August2017,the daywewerefinishing upthis analysis , a new sample was discovered being deployed , with a different C2 node and slightly different communication . An exploit in someone else ’s wrapper ? Before we get to details about the exploit used in this campaign , we should cover some history on EPS exploits in docx files . FireEye discovered a malicious docx exploiting a zero day vulnerability in Microsoft ’s Encapsulated Postscript ( EPS ) filter , in the summer of 2015 . This EPS exploit was assigned CVE-2015 - 2545 . In March 2017 , FireEye observed both nation state and financially motivated actors using EPS zero day exploits assigned as CVE-2017 - 0261 and CVE-2017 - 0262 , prior to Microsoft disabling EPS rendering in its Office products with an update inApril 2017 . So it is likely one of these three EPS exploits is being employed with the perpetrator activity under investigation , perhaps hoping that their targets have n’t applied theApril patch that would make every EPS exploit futile . Since docx files are just a Zip - compressed container , comparing them with a file tree view might be a quick way to assess similarity on a high level . In fact , all 23 known docx files used in this campaign are very nearly identical , with the same 12 component files . Varying checksums might have to do with build artifacts , perhaps even intentionally so , in order to generate a unique hash with each build . Figure 3 Tree view of docx container file used to target Russian banks last week Interesting enough 10 of these 12 docx component files ( everything but the image1.eps and document.xml files ) are datedApril 18 th . This is no coincidence ; in fact , those same docx component files were found in the attachment used by nation - state actors in their email targeting of an Eastern European Ministry of ForeignAffairs , back when this EPS exploit was still a zero day ( Figure 4 ) . Figure 4 Eastern European Ministry of Foreign Affairs targeted by suspected nation state actors So if we compare the tree view of that older docx container ( Figure 5 ) , we see that 10 of the same component files appear identical , and we can confirm that using cryptographic hashing . Figure 5 Tree view of "" Trump "" exploit docx container , with 10 of 12 files identical to 23 recent RU bank targeting samples described in this investigation Of special note is the common app.xml file , which comes directly from the decoy document in the “ Trump ” exploit file . This app.xml file contains the same URLto the California Courier website(www[.]thecaliforniacourier[.]com ) , where the textwascopiedfrom “ Trump’sAttackonSyria : Wrongfor soManyReasons ” as describedbyESETin theirexploit analysis . Clearly there was some “ borrowing ” going on between this current bank - targeting campaign and the previous nation - state espionage campaign . Does this suggest that these campaigns and actors are in any way complicit / related ? No . On the contrary , national interests seem to imply that those particular espionage - focused actors ( i.e. , from the “ Trump ” campaign ) would almost certainly NOT be involved in broadly exploiting Russian banks a few months later . That being said , an alternative hypothesis is that these bank - targeting actors purposely purloined the older espionage related docx files to introduce uncertainty and/or mis - attribution , or even to send a message to defenders or researchers . As we 'll see shortly , the attackers also interestingly signed ( commented ) their malware with lyrics from Slipknot 's Snuff .
