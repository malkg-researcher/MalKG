We have no evidence to suggest the actors behind the Monju Incident and King - slayer are related , other than they used one or more of the same tactics . 8 http://www.contextis.com/documents/30/TA10009_20140127_-_CTI_Threat_Advisory_- _ The_Monju_Incident1.pdf KINGSLAYER ’S MEMORY - RESIDENT BROTHER , THE K2 TROJAN RSA Research believes all of the particular Alpha application installations at­tempting to update during the 17 day Kingslayer subversion window received a malicious but otherwise functioning update .

Using passive analysis , RSA Research was able to identify the probable beaconing activity pattern used by the secondary malware . Like the Kingslayer backdoor loader , the secondary malware used the domain www.oraclesoft[.]net for C2 . We have dubbed this secondary malware “ Kingslayer Two ” or “ K2 . ” The beaconing pattern of K2 differed from the King - slayer backdoor that loaded it . K2 beacons every ten minutes without a defined sleep period . Based on passively observed beacon activity from three different K2 - infected systems , we believe K2 ’s HTTP GET beacon pattern is a three to four digit load identifier that may represent the K2 malware load sequence assigned to each unique infection .

This seems to be a technique to bypass behavior - based diagnostics of security solutions , which detect the creation of malware in document files . Fortunately , there is no new malware exploiting Hangul¡¯s vulnerabilities since the second half of 2016 . This means that the attacker is exploiting a vulnerability that has already been patched so the users can prevent attacks by simply conducting the latest Hangul security update .
