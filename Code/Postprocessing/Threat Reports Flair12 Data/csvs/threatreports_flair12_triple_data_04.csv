By comparing each last modi.ed time of the RAR archive with the one located in the meta data , we have con.dence to say that the time is not spoofed . So it makes sense to perform related statistics of all the bait documents captured . Statistics of the Last Modi.ed Time All of the last modi.ed time from the captured bait documents are shown in the table below : UTC+00 00:32 01:15 01:15 01:17 01:35 01:59 02:57 2/19/2019 360ÍþÐ²Çé±¨ÖÐÐÄ 03:28 04:40 04:55 05:17 12:27 12:49 12:50 13:38 13:42 13:49 14:21 14:22 15:19 15:26 15:30 15:56 17:22 17:58 18:31 20:53 21:31 23:30 From the above we could see that the time never distributed between 05:30 and 12:30 , which supposed to be sleep hours .
