IranÕs uranium enrichment facilities seem to be a more likely target for a cyber attack than does the Bushehr reactor . Mark Fitzpatrick , former acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Non.proliferation , argued in September that such an attack would not make sense because the reactor is not a prime proliferation concern , the Financial Times reported.23 Iranian officials have themselves indicated that the Bushehr reactor may not have been the wormÕs only target . For example , an October 5 statement from IranÕs Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast appeared to reference IranÕs uranium enrichment program.24 Moreover , Ali Akbar Salehi , the head of IranÕs Atomic Energy Organization , suggested September 29 that ÒenemiesÓ had attempted to infect nuclear facilities other than Bushehr.25 More recently , some experts have argued that , because Stuxnet was designed to manipulate equipment used in centrifuge facilities , the worm may have been developed to sabotage IranÕs enrichment plant.26 Whether the Natanz facility contains Siemens components that would be affected by the virus is unclear .

Despite the large volume of data obtained ( most of which has yet to be published ) , we still lack the answer to the fundamental question -who is behind Duqu ? In addition , there are other issues , mostly to do with the creation of the Trojan , or rather the platform used to implement Duqu as well as Stuxnet . In terms of architecture , the platform used to create Duqu and Stuxnet is the same . This is a driver file which loads a main module designed as an encrypted library . At the same time , there is a separate configuration file for the whole malicious complex and an encrypted block in the system registry that defines the location of the module being loaded and name of the process for injection . Conventional platform architecture for Stuxnet and Duqu This platform can be conventionally named as ' Tilded ' as its authors are , for some reason , inclined to use file names which start with "" ~d "" . We believe Duqu and Stuxnet were simultaneous projects supported by the same team of developers . Several other details have been uncovered which suggest there was possibly at least one further spyware module based on the same platform in 2007 - 2008 , and several other programs whose functionality was unclear between 2008 and 2010 .

Conclusion The Heartbeat campaign has been successfully executing targeted attacks since 2009 . In order for attackers to properly track their campaigns and victims , they used campaign codes that contained the campaign dates and strings that described specific campaigns . These campaign codes are embedded in their RAT binaries and were sent to their C&C servers along with information regarding the targetsÕ system . Additionally , they used a commercial site redirection service for their C&C domains . These domains redirected to various IP addresses that belonged to legitimate ISPs , which may be compromised hosts that act as proxy servers . This effectively hides the real location of the attackers behind HeartBeat . While having an isolated target may have helped them stay under the security industryÕs radar , the attackers illustrated that they were very careful but persistent . Understanding targeted campaigns and their methodologies is fundamental in protecting both end users and organizations . Not only does it help in coming up with effective defensive strategies through multiple protection layers , it also helps with predicting possible targets in the future and ultimately , raise awareness . As of this writing , the HeartBeat APT campaign remains an active targeted campaign . Timeline We collected 19 set of samples related to HeartBeat campaign from November 2009 to June 2012 .

IranÕs uranium enrichment facilities seem to be a more likely target for a cyber attack than does the Bushehr reactor . Mark Fitzpatrick , former acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Non.proliferation , argued in September that such an attack would not make sense because the reactor is not a prime proliferation concern , the Financial Times reported.23 Iranian officials have themselves indicated that the Bushehr reactor may not have been the wormÕs only target . For example , an October 5 statement from IranÕs Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast appeared to reference IranÕs uranium enrichment program.24 Moreover , Ali Akbar Salehi , the head of IranÕs Atomic Energy Organization , suggested September 29 that ÒenemiesÓ had attempted to infect nuclear facilities other than Bushehr.25 More recently , some experts have argued that , because Stuxnet was designed to manipulate equipment used in centrifuge facilities , the worm may have been developed to sabotage IranÕs enrichment plant.26 Whether the Natanz facility contains Siemens components that would be affected by the virus is unclear .

Conclusion The Heartbeat campaign has been successfully executing targeted attacks since 2009 . In order for attackers to properly track their campaigns and victims , they used campaign codes that contained the campaign dates and strings that described specific campaigns . These campaign codes are embedded in their RAT binaries and were sent to their C&C servers along with information regarding the targetsÕ system . Additionally , they used a commercial site redirection service for their C&C domains . These domains redirected to various IP addresses that belonged to legitimate ISPs , which may be compromised hosts that act as proxy servers . This effectively hides the real location of the attackers behind HeartBeat . While having an isolated target may have helped them stay under the security industryÕs radar , the attackers illustrated that they were very careful but persistent . Understanding targeted campaigns and their methodologies is fundamental in protecting both end users and organizations . Not only does it help in coming up with effective defensive strategies through multiple protection layers , it also helps with predicting possible targets in the future and ultimately , raise awareness .

"Evolution_Drivers_Duqu_Stuxnet","hasattacktime","Trojan","ORG","summer/autumn 2010","DATE","Although all known variations of Duqu are from the period November 2010 - October 2011 , we believe there were earlier versions of the Trojan spy created to steal information . The three drivers in question could easily have been used in early versions of Duqu or with other Trojans based on the Stuxnet / Duqu platform . Like Duqu , those Trojans were most probably used in targeted attacks before the appearance of Stuxnet ( dating back to at least 2008 ) , both while it was active and after its C&C was shut down . They were likely to have been parallel projects , and Stuxnet was subsequently based on that accumulated experience and the code that had already been written . It seems highly unlikely that this was the only project that its authors were involved in . The driver creation process Let 's try to imagine what the driver creation process looks like . A few times a year the authors compile a new version of a driver file , creating a reference file . The primary purpose of this file is to load and execute a main module , which is created separately . It could be Stuxnet , or Duqu or something else . When it is necessary to use a driver for a new module , the authors use a dedicated program to modify information in the driver 's "" reference "" file , i.e. its name and service information as well as the registry key and its value . It 's important to note that they tweak ready - made files and do n't create a new one from scratch . This means they can make as many different driver files as they like , each having exactly the same functionality and creation date . Depending on the aim of the attack and the Trojan 's victim , several driver files can then be signed with legitimate digital certificates whose origins remain unknown . Conclusion From the data we have at our disposal , we can say with a fair degree of certainty that the "" Tilded "" platform was created around the end of 2007 or early 2008 before undergoing its most significant changes in summer / autumn 2010 .
