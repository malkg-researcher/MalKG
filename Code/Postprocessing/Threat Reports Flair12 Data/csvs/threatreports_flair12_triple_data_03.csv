The get_command is sent as POST request with an argument called name that contains a tag . This tag is used as a form of authentication and is influenced by the compilation time of the file . In our tests , the servers always seem to respond with a 404 if asked for a command . The FileSearcher component loops through every drive and looks for files with certain extensions . The malicious binary has an extension list embedded ( usually identifying different types of documents ) . If a file with an extension from that list is found , it will be copied into a temporary zip archive . After completing adding the files to the archive , it will split it into hidden .sft encrypted files . The .sft files are read by the Exfiltration component , sent to the C&C server and deleted from the disk . After the exfiltration process is completed , the Exfiltration component will wait for further commands as described above . As mentioned earlier , the files that will be exfiltrated are first copied into a zip file . This zip file will be encrypted into multiple .sft files as follows : . The File Searcher component will read 2048 bytes from the zip file . For each byte it will apply a xor operation between the least significant 4 bits and the most significant 4 bits and it will write the result in the .sft file . The first two steps are repeated a maximum of 53 times . If the zip file still has unprocessed data , a new .sft file will be created . For each zip file , the first .sft file will have a N prepended as a first character , the rest of the .sft files which complete an archive will have an O prepended . Victims While screening the victims it was obvious that this threat is an extremely targeted one . The majority of victims are concentrated in the area of Turkey and Syria . Zooming in , we were able to observe that most of the targets are located near the border between Turkey and Syria , as well as in Istanbul , enforcing the idea that this threat might be involved in the geo - political conflict between Turkey and the Kurdish community .

The get_command is sent as POST request with an argument called name that contains a tag . This tag is used as a form of authentication and is influenced by the compilation time of the file . In our tests , the servers always seem to respond with a 404 if asked for a command . The FileSearcher component loops through every drive and looks for files with certain extensions . The malicious binary has an extension list embedded ( usually identifying different types of documents ) . If a file with an extension from that list is found , it will be copied into a temporary zip archive . After completing adding the files to the archive , it will split it into hidden .sft encrypted files . The .sft files are read by the Exfiltration component , sent to the C&C server and deleted from the disk . After the exfiltration process is completed , the Exfiltration component will wait for further commands as described above . As mentioned earlier , the files that will be exfiltrated are first copied into a zip file . This zip file will be encrypted into multiple .sft files as follows : . The File Searcher component will read 2048 bytes from the zip file . For each byte it will apply a xor operation between the least significant 4 bits and the most significant 4 bits and it will write the result in the .sft file . The first two steps are repeated a maximum of 53 times . If the zip file still has unprocessed data , a new .sft file will be created . For each zip file , the first .sft file will have a N prepended as a first character , the rest of the .sft files which complete an archive will have an O prepended . Victims While screening the victims it was obvious that this threat is an extremely targeted one . The majority of victims are concentrated in the area of Turkey and Syria . Zooming in , we were able to observe that most of the targets are located near the border between Turkey and Syria , as well as in Istanbul , enforcing the idea that this threat might be involved in the geo - political conflict between Turkey and the Kurdish community .

The get_command is sent as POST request with an argument called name that contains a tag . This tag is used as a form of authentication and is influenced by the compilation time of the file . In our tests , the servers always seem to respond with a 404 if asked for a command . The FileSearcher component loops through every drive and looks for files with certain extensions . The malicious binary has an extension list embedded ( usually identifying different types of documents ) . If a file with an extension from that list is found , it will be copied into a temporary zip archive . After completing adding the files to the archive , it will split it into hidden .sft encrypted files . The .sft files are read by the Exfiltration component , sent to the C&C server and deleted from the disk . After the exfiltration process is completed , the Exfiltration component will wait for further commands as described above . As mentioned earlier , the files that will be exfiltrated are first copied into a zip file . This zip file will be encrypted into multiple .sft files as follows : . The File Searcher component will read 2048 bytes from the zip file . For each byte it will apply a xor operation between the least significant 4 bits and the most significant 4 bits and it will write the result in the .sft file . The first two steps are repeated a maximum of 53 times . If the zip file still has unprocessed data , a new .sft file will be created . For each zip file , the first .sft file will have a N prepended as a first character , the rest of the .sft files which complete an archive will have an O prepended .

"report-spark-bahamut","hasmember","InPage","WORK_OF_ART","three","CARDINAL","Under the Microscope Returning now to the Kaspersky write - up , BlackBerry took note of the fact that the InPage documents described were used to target both ¡ ° financial and governmental institutions.¡± Kaspersky identified banks in Asia and Africa as specific targets , and they provided a screenshot showing a relevant phishing email from April 10 , 2013 : Curiously , the date of this phishing email predates other time references within the text of the article by nearly three years . This prompted BlackBerry to examine the samples Kaspersky had listed much more closely , specifically : 085de1580421aefe1d581f4b6012a485e2665cee78630b6a0c311ee3bc8409b6 43ffd4791798059b29170fe9b6d37cb3a18b1907c2b58a3c804973ca1d656505 The sample beginning ¡ ° 085¡± communicated directly to an IP address ¡ ° 91.219.238[.]246¡±. This IP was significant because BlackBerry noted that recently developed and undisclosed BAHAMUT malware samples communicated with the same exact IP address . We then identified eleven other samples in total that communicated with this IP . They were all Windows malware : 1305e7aea00eadecdc6fe143c0e91f93e9b6d5dc13407375e0e3dab7e5b99072 20862996f0511f9a3bd1d92c690bb499a6fbb07683889cba2c2d574a34d881da 541cb62c5a9583f82b89c73b47b495be2485b20d95120aab7e3552ce71fc0774 7b3a0273ca92cb17656df4522779b92d43bdbee1980eb4302c949f30dae8d0fa 9c03e5e4fb8774b28a56ca519e8a9de0f5704674d91bac6ffb129426b830755e a2f40cf78a5f595409d5bc714abb09f62f2322a5e486687c43ef7d2b5f436f00 c1330eb733712935f47a125704c11149a1e09601791bce44ccb067bf19d43bb0 c2454805fa90df13253d0bf20ddaab92c1c13e04b72cf74ad0998b76d4efc67c c8cc9ac7895717e1e82ec02d2787b910eca81e906c0c1da2896fc1c0a34f6e83 e48a58d0f5d5fb8aa7c96c7b47afc7a6b682078797caef53e7d353483f10e82a f816bcbb61d0bd495ea9e920c52825b020bd38dbc4f42c05f955ed34f7207ac3 It¡¯s not entirely clear why BAHAMUT would use this particular IP address for more than four years . It was highly unlike them to do so . BlackBerry speculates that this address was likely a component of BAHAMUT¡¯s C2 infrastructure , only used in secondary or tertiary payloads . Direct- to - IP communication in BAHAMUT - related malware is relatively uncommon . Taking advantage of the discovery of IP crossover between recent BAHAMUT malware C2 and malware described in the Kasperksy write - up , BlackBerry linked three other recent samples conclusively as being delivered from the following URLs .

The get_command is sent as POST request with an argument called name that contains a tag . This tag is used as a form of authentication and is influenced by the compilation time of the file . In our tests , the servers always seem to respond with a 404 if asked for a command . The FileSearcher component loops through every drive and looks for files with certain extensions . The malicious binary has an extension list embedded ( usually identifying different types of documents ) . If a file with an extension from that list is found , it will be copied into a temporary zip archive . After completing adding the files to the archive , it will split it into hidden .sft encrypted files . The .sft files are read by the Exfiltration component , sent to the C&C server and deleted from the disk . After the exfiltration process is completed , the Exfiltration component will wait for further commands as described above . As mentioned earlier , the files that will be exfiltrated are first copied into a zip file . This zip file will be encrypted into multiple .sft files as follows : . The File Searcher component will read 2048 bytes from the zip file . For each byte it will apply a xor operation between the least significant 4 bits and the most significant 4 bits and it will write the result in the .sft file . The first two steps are repeated a maximum of 53 times . If the zip file still has unprocessed data , a new .sft file will be created . For each zip file , the first .sft file will have a N prepended as a first character , the rest of the .sft files which complete an archive will have an O prepended . Victims While screening the victims it was obvious that this threat is an extremely targeted one . The majority of victims are concentrated in the area of Turkey and Syria . Zooming in , we were able to observe that most of the targets are located near the border between Turkey and Syria , as well as in Istanbul , enforcing the idea that this threat might be involved in the geo - political conflict between Turkey and the Kurdish community .

The get_command is sent as POST request with an argument called name that contains a tag . This tag is used as a form of authentication and is influenced by the compilation time of the file . In our tests , the servers always seem to respond with a 404 if asked for a command . The FileSearcher component loops through every drive and looks for files with certain extensions . The malicious binary has an extension list embedded ( usually identifying different types of documents ) . If a file with an extension from that list is found , it will be copied into a temporary zip archive . After completing adding the files to the archive , it will split it into hidden .sft encrypted files . The .sft files are read by the Exfiltration component , sent to the C&C server and deleted from the disk . After the exfiltration process is completed , the Exfiltration component will wait for further commands as described above . As mentioned earlier , the files that will be exfiltrated are first copied into a zip file . This zip file will be encrypted into multiple .sft files as follows : . The File Searcher component will read 2048 bytes from the zip file . For each byte it will apply a xor operation between the least significant 4 bits and the most significant 4 bits and it will write the result in the .sft file . The first two steps are repeated a maximum of 53 times . If the zip file still has unprocessed data , a new .sft file will be created . For each zip file , the first .sft file will have a N prepended as a first character , the rest of the .sft files which complete an archive will have an O prepended . Victims While screening the victims it was obvious that this threat is an extremely targeted one . The majority of victims are concentrated in the area of Turkey and Syria . Zooming in , we were able to observe that most of the targets are located near the border between Turkey and Syria , as well as in Istanbul , enforcing the idea that this threat might be involved in the geo - political conflict between Turkey and the Kurdish community .

This prompted BlackBerry to examine the samples Kaspersky had listed much more closely , specifically : 085de1580421aefe1d581f4b6012a485e2665cee78630b6a0c311ee3bc8409b6 43ffd4791798059b29170fe9b6d37cb3a18b1907c2b58a3c804973ca1d656505 The sample beginning ¡ ° 085¡± communicated directly to an IP address ¡ ° 91.219.238[.]246¡±.

The get_command is sent as POST request with an argument called name that contains a tag . This tag is used as a form of authentication and is influenced by the compilation time of the file . In our tests , the servers always seem to respond with a 404 if asked for a command . The FileSearcher component loops through every drive and looks for files with certain extensions . The malicious binary has an extension list embedded ( usually identifying different types of documents ) . If a file with an extension from that list is found , it will be copied into a temporary zip archive . After completing adding the files to the archive , it will split it into hidden .sft encrypted files . The .sft files are read by the Exfiltration component , sent to the C&C server and deleted from the disk . After the exfiltration process is completed , the Exfiltration component will wait for further commands as described above . As mentioned earlier , the files that will be exfiltrated are first copied into a zip file . This zip file will be encrypted into multiple .sft files as follows : . The File Searcher component will read 2048 bytes from the zip file . For each byte it will apply a xor operation between the least significant 4 bits and the most significant 4 bits and it will write the result in the .sft file . The first two steps are repeated a maximum of 53 times . If the zip file still has unprocessed data , a new .sft file will be created . For each zip file , the first .sft file will have a N prepended as a first character , the rest of the .sft files which complete an archive will have an O prepended . Victims While screening the victims it was obvious that this threat is an extremely targeted one . The majority of victims are concentrated in the area of Turkey and Syria .

The get_command is sent as POST request with an argument called name that contains a tag . This tag is used as a form of authentication and is influenced by the compilation time of the file . In our tests , the servers always seem to respond with a 404 if asked for a command . The FileSearcher component loops through every drive and looks for files with certain extensions . The malicious binary has an extension list embedded ( usually identifying different types of documents ) . If a file with an extension from that list is found , it will be copied into a temporary zip archive . After completing adding the files to the archive , it will split it into hidden .sft encrypted files . The .sft files are read by the Exfiltration component , sent to the C&C server and deleted from the disk . After the exfiltration process is completed , the Exfiltration component will wait for further commands as described above . As mentioned earlier , the files that will be exfiltrated are first copied into a zip file . This zip file will be encrypted into multiple .sft files as follows : . The File Searcher component will read 2048 bytes from the zip file . For each byte it will apply a xor operation between the least significant 4 bits and the most significant 4 bits and it will write the result in the .sft file . The first two steps are repeated a maximum of 53 times . If the zip file still has unprocessed data , a new .sft file will be created . For each zip file , the first .sft file will have a N prepended as a first character , the rest of the .sft files which complete an archive will have an O prepended .
