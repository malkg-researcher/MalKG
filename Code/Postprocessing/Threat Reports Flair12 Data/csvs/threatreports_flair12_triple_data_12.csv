"snake_whitepaper","usesaddress","1,898","MONEY","0  1  2  3","CARDINAL","BTZ ” , meaning it was registered as unknown malicious sample # 1,898 in an anti - virus classification system . It was n’t given an actual name , only a generic one . Meanwhile , internally the authors behind this malware were using their own naming systems - with specific titles for their file components and projects such as “ snake ” , “ uroburos ” , “ sengoku ” , and “ snark “ used to denote variants of their framework . A recent report from German security company GData3 described a sample from the “ uroburos ” variant of this framework . Their report revealed the complex nature of this malware family , and showed that the operation behind “ Agent . BTZ ” has continued . As a result of this disclosure , we are also releasing our own technical analysis of the threat , including a timeline of known samples , known Command - and - Control ( C&C ) servers , and other indicators to aid investigators in discovering attacks . Reverse engineering of recent malware samples shows these to be much more advanced variants of Agent . BTZ , though still sharing many similarities and encryption methods with the original . Further investigation allowed us to locate related samples compiled between 2006 and 2014 , and spanning across several distinctive generations . The first section of this report gives an overview of the samples collected , where they were reported and the timelines derived from their analysis . Snake ’s architecture turned out to be quite interesting . We have identified two distinct variants , both highly flexible but with two different techniques for establishing and maintaining a presence on the target system . In general , its operation relies on kernel mode drivers , making it a rootkit . It is designed to covertly install a backdoor on a compromised system , hide the presence of its components , provide a communication mechanism with its C&C servers , and enable an effective data exfiltration mechanism . At the same time , Snake exposed a flexibility to conduct its operations by engaging these noticeably different architectures . In the first model , the network communications are carried out from the userland - i.e. the area of the computer system where application software executes . In another model , the network communications are handled by a kernel mode driver - i.e. the area where lower level system code such as device drivers run . The choice of what architecture should be used may depend on a specific target ’s environment , allowing the Snake operators to choose the most suitable architecture to be deployed . In both architectures there is a kernel mode driver installed and a usermode DLL injected by the driver into the system processes . In both architectures , there is both 32 - bit and 64 - bit code involved . In order to distinguish between these architectures , we will call them the usermode - centric and the kernel - centric architectures respectively . The remainder of this report gives a detailed explanation of how the two Snake architectures embed themselves in the target system and communicate with the outside world . We have also provided a set of technical indicators in the Appendix to enable organisations and the security research community to identify compromises . 3 https://www.gdata.de/rdk/dl-en-rp-Uroburos SNAKE SAMPLES In total we have collected over 100 unique files related to this espionage toolkit . Many of these were submitted to online malware analysis websites by victims and investigators over several years . In many cases the source country information of the submission is available . These allow us to visualise the distribution of countries where this malware has been seen : Whilst this view is likely to only be the tip of the iceberg , it does give us an initial insight into the profile of targets for the Snake operations . Other useful visualisations of the operations come from the compile timestamps . Below is shown a table with a count of the number of files in our sample set from recent years . Two samples compiled in late January 2014 show that this activity is ongoing . Plotting the day of the week in which the samples were compiled shows a now familiar pattern for analysts of modern cyber - attacks . The creators of the malware operate a working week , just like any other professional . The single sample in our set which was compiled on a Saturday is an outlier , but does n’t alter the conclusion . Similarly , plotting the hour of the day in which the samples were compiled reveals another human pattern – the working day . This has been adjusted to UTC+4 to show a possible fit to the operators ’ local time . # Samples compiled per day of the week # Samples compiled by hour of the day ( adjusted to UTC+4 ) Mon Tue We d Thu Fri Sat Sun The usermode - centric architecture of Snake is known to have been used from 2011 till 2014 , with the most recent sample compiled on January 28 , 2014 . With this architecture , the Snake driver is mainly used to load the DLL module into the usermode processes , and then use that module for the communications . One of the analysed samples exposed multiple debug messages and source control check - in logs . It is not clear why those messages were allowed in the deployed driver - possibly an operational security lapse . However , they give some insight into the internal structure of the source code . For example , the analysed driver gave away the following source file names : • d:\proj\cn\fa64\common\loadlib\common / loadlib_helpers.c • d:\proj\cn\fa64\common\loadlib\win / loadlib.c • d:\proj\cn\fa64\uroboros\rk_common\libhook\common / libunhook.c • d:\proj\cn\fa64\uroboros\rk_common\libhook\ntsystem / libhook.c • d:\proj\cn\fa64\uroboros\rk_common\libhook\common / hook_helpers.c • d:\proj\cn\fa64\uroboros\rk_common\libhook\common / libhook.c • d:\proj\cn\fa64\uroboros\rk_common\libhook\common / idthook.c • .\rk_ntsystem.c • .. \common\helpers\interface_s.c • .. \k2\fa_registry.c • .. \k2\syshook.c The source control check - in log examples , showing the names of the developers to be ‘ vlad ’ and ‘ gilg ’ :  $ I d : snake_config.c 5204 2007 - 01 - 04 10:28:19Z vlad $  $ I d : mime64.c 12892 2010 - 06 - 24 14:31:59Z vlad $  $ I d : event.c 14097 2010 - 11 - 01 14:46:27Z gilg $  $ I d : named_mutex.c 15594 2011 - 03 - 18 08:04:09Z gilg $  $ I d : nt.c 20719 2012 - 12 - 05 12:31:20Z gilg $  $ I d : ntsystem.c 19662 2012 - 07 - 09 13:17:17Z gilg $  $ I d : rw_lock.c 14516 2010 - 11 - 29 12:27:33Z gilg $  $ I d : rk_bpf.c 14518 2010 - 11 - 29 12:28:30Z gilg $  $ I d : t_status.c 14478 2010 - 11 - 27 12:41:22Z gilg $ It also exposed the project name of this particular variant as ‘ sengoku ’ : d:\proj\cn\fa64\sengoku\_bin\sengoku\win32_debug\sengoku_Win32.pdb Now it ’s time to execute the driver and see what it does . ROOTKIT EXECUTION When first executed , the driver creates device named \Device\vstor32 with a symbolic link \DosDevices\vstor32 . This device is used for userland / kernel communications . Next , it drops a DLL into the % windows% directory - the DLL is carried in the body of the driver as a binary chunk with XOR 0xAA applied on top of it , so the driver decrypts it first . Depending on the variant , the DLL is dropped either under a random name or a hard - coded name , such as mscpx32n.dll . The purpose of this DLL is to be injected into the user - mode processes . Some variants of Snake carry the DLL modules that can be installed as a service , to be run within taskhost.exe or services.exe processes . Next , the driver sets up the hooks for the following kernel - mode APIs :  ZwCreateThread  ZwCreateUserProcess  ZwShutdownSystem After that , it calls PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine ( ) in order to be notified whenever a new process is started . The handlers of the hooks above along with the notification callback allow Snake to stay persistent on a system , being able to infect any newly created processes , and restore its driver file in case it gets deleted . Another set of hooks it sets is designed to hide the presence of the Snake components on the system :  ZwQuerySystemInformation  ZwQueryInformationProcess  ZwClose  ZwTerminateProcess The driver then watches for all userland processes to see if they load any web pages . As long as the user is not using the Internet , Snake stays dormant too , as there is no process that communicates with the web servers . However , as soon as the user goes online , the driver intercepts that event and then immediately injects the malicious DLL module into the process that initiated connection ( the browser ) . Once injected , the module initiates polling from one of the hard - coded C&C servers . The purpose of this behaviour is to blend Snake ’s traffic with the browser traffic , bypassing the firewalls , and keeping a low profile at the same time . By communicating from within a process that also communicates , even a technically savvy user will find it challenging to detect Snake traffic among legitimate traffic . The reason behind such difficulty is because modern web pages often fetch pages from the different web servers , including such data as additional scripts , CSS templates , advertising contents , analytics data , blogs , social networking data , etc . When intercepted with the purpose of analysis , such traffic may literally represent itself hundreds of DNS and HTTP requests made when a popular website , such as a news website is open . Hiding a few DNS / HTTP requests among busy network traffic allows Snake rootkit to stay unnoticed . In order to test Snake ’s communications with the C&C servers , and still being able to clearly distinguish its traffic , a small tool was built to generate GET request to a web server running on the analysed system . The tool was named as chrome.exe in order to trigger the malware communications . 137 50.536285000 192.168.202.131 31.170.161.136 HTTP 220 GET /D/77568289 HTTP/1.1 139 50.762073000 31.170.161.136 192.168.202.131 HTTP 474 HTTP/1.1 302 Found ( text / html ) 147 51.101706000 192.168.202.131 31.170.164.249 HTTP 217 GET / ?

The value contains a detailed timestamp including minutes and even seconds of compilation time ( think of it as the ô€€²le 's moment of birth ) .

The answer is : not fully , because the link timestamp can be altered by the developer in a way that 's not always possible to spot . However , certain indicators such as matching the year on the timestamp with the support of technology popular in that year leads us to believe that the timestamps were , at the very least , not wholly replaced . Looking at this from the other side , the easiest option for the developer is to wipe the timestamp completely , replacing it with zeroes . This was not found in the case of EquationDrug . In fact , the timestamps look very realistic and match the working days and hours of a well - organized software developer from timezone UTC-3 or UTC-4 , if you assume that they come to work at 8 or 9 am . The timestamps match the working days of software developer from timezone UTC-3 or UTC-4 # EquationAPT Tweet[17 ] 6 of 30 03/22/2015 10:21 PM http://securelist.com/blog/research/69203/inside-t ...
