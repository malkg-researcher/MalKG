"Dissecting-LinuxMoose","indicates","Linux/Moose  4.2","PRODUCT","24 hours","TIME","We ran one infected host for 24 hours and measured its level of activity and its success rate at finding potential peers or connecting to exposed Telnet services . Here are our results :       Connection AttemptsPotentially Infected HostsTelnet Hosts with Login Prompt  Responding HostsTelnet Responding HostsTelnet Connection Attempts Figure 7 Scanning behavior over 24 hours Over 24 hours , almost 170000 connection attempts were made on port 10073 , meant for 23000 unique hosts . Of those , 36 completed the TCP handshake , which means that they might be infected , or they have another service on this port2 , or they are firewalled weirdly3 . 85000 Telnet connection attempts were made on 18000 unique hosts , of which 161 responded with a login banner . These numbers have to be taken with a grain of salt since they depend heavily on the type of hardware on which the malware runs . We ran it under software emulation â€ ” which is usually way slower than real hardware â€ ” in a virtualized Intel server â€ ” which is way more powerful than most routers . In other words , we donâ€ ™ t know how these numbers compare to real infected hardware but we tend to think that they should be comparable . Internet scan Finally , we asked our friends at Rapid7 to scan the Internet on both port 10073 and 23 ( Telnet ) in order to get a sense of how many Internet - facing devices listen to both ports . It turns out about 1 million IP addresses fit that description . If we remove the devices that had no Telnet banner , that number is reduced to around 50,000 potentially infected hosts . Still , this number is probably an overestimate because of the wild nature of the Internet and yet might also be an under estimate since many publicly unreachable and therefore uncounted devices might be infected . All of these indicators taken together , while only educated guesses , leads us to think that this threat is real and should be taken seriously . 2 Although possible , we randomly inspected a sample of the servers and saw very few with actual responding services on the 10073 port 3 TCP FIN instead of RST or dropping the packets , which is usually the best practice Dissecting Linux / Moose 4.2 .

Further research revealed that this malware has been active since at least 2008 and the country where the malware has been seen most is Ukraine .

IndiaBravo - PapaAlfa Internet Network Moniter provides performance library information from Windows Management Instrumentation providers network . If the Service is not running , Wmi Security log is not being saved . Table 3 - 1 : Description Values for the IndiaBravo Variants Operation Blockbuster : Loaders , Installers and Uninstallers Report Once IndiaBravo completes its task of dropping the configuration for its malware , dropping the malware itself , and finally creating and activating a service to ensure the malwareâ€ ™ s persistence , IndiaBravo then terminates . Console applications , such as IndiaBravo , return an exit code upon completion . While the return code for an application is usually set to 0 and subsequently ignored by the calling application ( such as cmd.exe ) , the exit code can provide status information about a program to the caller , allowing the caller to determine success or failure of an applicationâ€ ™ s task . This is a common practice for scriptable applications . IndiaBravo actively uses the exit code feature to signal the status of its operation , returning a value of 0 to 4 depending on if an error occurred and , if so , what part of the framework experienced the error . Table 3 - 2 explains the meaning of each exit code : EXIT CODE DESCRIPTION 0 IndiaBravo successfully completed 1 ( variant dependent ) 2 WriteConfig failed 3 ExtractDll failed 4 CreateSVC failed Table 3 - 2 : IndiaBravoâ€ ™ s Exit Codes Because each of the IndiaBravo variants customizes the framework to fit the needs of the malware and the developer , the following subsections explore the key variations between each of the IndiaBravo variants . Operation Blockbuster : Loaders , Installers and Uninstallers Report 3.1 IndiaBravo - RomeoBravo Variant IndiaBravo - RomeoBravo ( IBRB ) is the installer responsible for dropping the RomeoBravo malware . IBRB begins by dropping the malware binary at % SYSDIR%\wmisecsvc.dll . Compared to other IndiaBravo variants , the line of demarcation between IBRBâ€ ™ s ExtractDll and WriteConfig functions is more blurred based on the fact that ExtractDll also extracts a configuration data blob of 456 bytes from the IBRB binary . The configuration data exists immediately before the RomeoBravo image and is stored in plaintext . ExtractDll loads the configuration blob into memory . Once ExtractDll completes the file and configuration data extraction , WriteConfig modifies the configuration data blob by assigning a 64 - bit , randomly generated value to the qwIdentifier field of the RomeoBravo configuration . The WriteConfig encrypts the configuration data using the DNSCALC - style encoding scheme , and the encrypted configuration is then dropped to disk at % SYSDIR%\tmscompg.ini . The CreateSVC function follows the general IndiaBravo method of establishing a new service , but , specifically , the function generates a new service group named LocalWmiSecurity after establishing the registry entries necessary to define the WmiSecSvc service . IBRB monitors the status of each of the installation tasks and , if any of the tasks fails , calls a suicide script ( saved in the % TEMP% directory as cvrit000.bat ) to remove its binary . The suicide script , Figure 3 - 2 , only removes the IBRB binary and will not attempt to clean up any of the successful steps that may have occurred during the installation process . : L1 del "" < full path to > wmisecsvc.dll "" if exist "" < full path to > wmisecsvc.dll "" goto L1 del < full path to > cvrit000.bat Figure 3 - 2 : IndiaBravo - RomeoBravoâ€ ™ s Suicide Script After completing the installation and activation tasks , IBRB then calls the suicide script to remove itself from the victimâ€ ™ s machine . Operation Blockbuster : Loaders , Installers and Uninstallers Report 3.2 IndiaBravo - RomeoCharlie Variant IndiaBravo - RomeoCharlie ( IBRC ) is a verbose installer for the RomeoCharlie malware . IBRC records each step of the installation process to STDOUT .

Further research revealed that this malware has been active since at least 2008 and the country where the malware has been seen most is Ukraine .
