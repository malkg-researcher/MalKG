At the request of the web root , which acts as a gate for the JS - sniffer , users are redirected to msn.com . TokenLogin and TokenMSN JS - sniffer families also share similarities .

"ESET_Threat_Report_Q32020","usesmalware","Roman Kovác","PERSON","3","CARDINAL","Roman Kovác , Chief Research Officer ESET researchers reveal that bugs similar to KrØØk affect more chip brands than previously thought . Our discovery of the KrØØk vulnerability had a huge impact as the number of affected devices was well over a billion including devices by Apple , Samsung , Amazon , and others that use the vulner­able chipsets . And we recently uncovered that similar bugs affect even more chip brands than previously thought . From KrØØk to finding related vulnerabilities KrØØk [ 1 ] ( formally CVE-2019 - 15126 ) is a vulnerability in Broadcom and Cypress Wi - Fi chips [ 2 ] that allows unauthorized decryption of some WPA2 - encrypted traffic . Specifically , the bug has led to wireless network data being encrypted with a pairwise session key that is all zeros instead of the proper session key that had previously been established in the 4 - way handshake . This undesirable state occurs on vulnerable Broadcom and Cypress chips following a Wi - Fi disassociation . Exploiting KrØØk allows adversaries to intercept and decrypt ( potentially sen­sitive ) data of interest and , when com­pared to other techniques commonly used against Wi - Fi , exploiting KrØØk has a sig­nificant advantage : the attackers do not need to be authenticated and associated to the WLAN . In other words , they do n’t need to know the Wi - Fi password . We worked with the affected vendors ( as well as ICASI [ 3 ] ) through a coor­dinated disclosure process before we first publicly disclosed the flaw at the RSA Conference in February 2020 "
