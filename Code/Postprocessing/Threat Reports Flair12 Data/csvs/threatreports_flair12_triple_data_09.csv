A Closer Look at the Encryption Algorithms Used in Carbon - DLL and Tavdig The malware found at RUAG was Carbon - DLL , paired with Tavdig . This section contains some technical and mathematical findings about the implementation of the cryptographic algorithms gained by reverse- engineering the code . The section can be skipped without loosing too much context for the rest of this paper , but it can also give some insight into the development of the malware . MODUS OPERANDI 15 / 32 MELANI : GovCERT TLP WHITE Understanding cryptographic algorithms is a key point for understanding the malware . It is also interesting to see some differences in how they are actually implemented in Tavdig and in Carbon . From the perspective of a reverser , Carbonâ€ ™ s approach is easier : Carbon uses the Microsofts cryptography API ( MSCAPI ) ; The standard MSCAPI calls CryptEncrypt and CryptDecrypt are imported via IAT ( Import Address Table ) and so become directly visible ( to be precise , a slight obfuscation is applied to hide these calls by building the IAT on the heap , instead of using the standard import table ) .

"Report_Ruag-Espionage-Case","indicates","GovCERT  TLP  WHITE","PRODUCT","two","CARDINAL","Note that trivial XOR instructions occur frequently in any code , these are exclusive ORs of a value with itself , which always returns 0 ; this is often used by compilers to just initialize a variable to 0 ; hence weâ€ ™ re only looking for XORâ€ ™ s with two different operands . The situation is far trickier for asymmetric cryptography , as these algorithms donâ€ ™ t use any reliable cryptographic constants , they donâ€ ™ t even use non - trivial XOR instructions . However , they require mathematical functions ( big integer functions ) to do calculations with very large integers of 1024 bits and more inside a finite field , i.e. modulus a large prime number , which is called the modulus of the field . One approach is identifying these functions and the library used by the programmers in their implementation . Unfortunately , we could not identify the library used by the programmers of Tavdig -we donâ€ ™ t even know if it is a public one or not . The code has some unusual features though ; letâ€ ™ s have a closer look at it . First , the following screenshot shows the implementation of long addition , which is still quite straightforward : Figure 11 : Addition of Two 1024 Bit Integers MODUS OPERANDI 17 / 32 MELANI : GovCERT TLP WHITE As you can see , not much red anymore , only blue .
